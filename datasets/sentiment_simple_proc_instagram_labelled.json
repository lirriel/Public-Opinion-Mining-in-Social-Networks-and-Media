They know what happened. They know it happened to you. That you were raped. Or sometimes you have a flashback while going about your day. You have thoughts that make you feel different, so you imagine everyone knows. That you're an outsider. That you've been branded. You might as well have a capital 'r' on your forehead to make it less awkward. Except you're wrong. Being raped is not a reflection of your actions. Of your worth. Of your beauty. Don't be ashamed of surviving something over which you had no control. It happened. You couldn't have predicted it. It doesn't make you weak. It actually makes you strong. Use what happened to empower you to love yourself more. And spread that love. To make a difference in the world. To fight for what's right. To stand up for people who are misunderstood. You didn't have a choice over being raped, but you have a choice over how you let it influence your future. And the future of others who need to hear your voice.

Barring some miracle, it\u2019s going to be Mr. Biden. So what is the greatest good or the greatest harm? Mr. Biden, and the Democrats he may carry with him into government, are likely to do more good for women and the nation than his competition, the worst president in the history of the Republic. Compared with the good Mr. Biden can do, the cost of dismissing Tara Reade \u2014 and, worse, weakening the voices of future survivors \u2014 is worth it. And don\u2019t call me an amoral realist. Utilitarianism is not a moral abdication; it is a moral stance.\u201d- Linda Hirshman, author \u201cReckoning: The Epic Battle Against Sexual Abuse and Harassment.\u201d I know this is a controversial issue and I understand the different viewpoints on this. I think it\u2019s a mistake to dismiss Reade as a liar or attack her for coming forward. I also think it\u2019s a mistake to withhold a vote from Biden and let a man who has dozens of sexual assault allegations (and who bragged on tape about doing the very thing Biden is accused of) remain in office. Trump is a danger to this country. People are dying by the tens of thousands because he fucked up the response to this pandemic. We can\u2019t let him kill us for four more years.

Even when I was a kid, I was made to believe things about myself.. such as that I'm not worthy, I'm ugly, I'm different from all other smartly dressed kids, I look like a beggar, I look like I escaped an asylum. All this said by my own mother. Right from when I was a baby. I remember it from when I was 7. This lead to lack of confidence, reduced social skills. More over, because of my introverted behaviour, I was also sexually harassed because the person who did it knew I wouldn't speak out. Was I depressed? I think I was. I never told anyone of my sadness. Finally when I was in 11th, my mom moved to another country because of a job opportunity, leaving me free from her. Turns out, she had a secret life of her own and had boyfriends. What I'm trying to say is there's a reason your parents are like this. Maybe their own parents raised them up like this, or maybe they have some problems they're keeping to themselves. They're still at fault, I'm not saying they're not. They're largely at fault for doing what they did to you. The best solution for me to deal with all was - God, time, and distance. 1. Pray to God, He is the source of peace. 2. As time passes, some things and people get tired of nagging you, but nevertheless, wounds start to heal. 3. Distance really helps too. When you distance yourself from them, your well-being improves.","352":"Hon, honestly if anyone needs anyone to talk to , my dms are open all the time\ud83d\udc97","353":"Michael Scott - \"Do I Inspire people?

Doesn\u2019t compare. Period. Especially if you\u2019re an adult who was not abused as a child bc you\u2019ve already been taught right from wrong  and know the difference a child never had the opportunity to decipher that- they\u2019ve only known pain since they can remember.

If anything the molester should be excused by insanity then. It's mostly to illustrate that no abuse or abuser should be excused, regardless of the gradation. I'm not sure if we can judge gradations, there are adults who have vulnerabilities too. I do definitely agree that taking advantage of these vulnerabilities can make the perpetrator worse.

It is India\u2019s first-ever portal for women\u2019s legal rights. The legal system in India is so complex that it creates a huge gap between the law and the common people. Pink legal helps bridge this gap of understanding and making women aware of their legal rights. Raising awareness is possibly the first and biggest step to the solution. There's never been a revolution without discourse. When it comes to law, information is key. Having a portal that's accessible to everyone opens up unlimited support and resources for women in India.

The truth is that I had a difficult time. A few years ago, a 'friend' raped me. I thought I was over it, but I wasn't. I had to read a book named 'South of Forgiveness' and it was a huge trigger, but it gave me some insights in my own experience. I've always somehow blamed myself for what happened and I've been hiding it for so long. Now I know better. It was never my fault. We've been taught to not drink too much, to not wear sexy clothes, to not walk alone at night... But the sad truth is even if we do those things, we'd still get raped. Even if we fight, there's a chance we get murdered like Julie van Espen. Why do they teach us how to protect ourselves when the only one who can stop this are the perpetrators? And why are we shaming victims for telling their story? To silence them? I won't be silent anymore and I'm done hiding. My life has been grey for so long, but now it's time to take the power back. Even if this process hurts, I will come out stronger and some day I will live free again without being scared\ud83c\udf3c\u2764\ufe0f I'm sorry if something like this happened to you.

Their reactions have made me doubt myself, my understandings and my experiences of sexual violence. So much so that I hesitated to post this because I was scared. Scared that I would lose followers. Scared that people would hate me or would say things that would make me feel unsafe or wrong.But what also kept ringing around in my head was the words of Judith Herman. In Trauma and Recovery (1992) Herman writes, \u201cIt is very tempting to take the side of the perpetrator. All the perpetrator asks is that the bystander do nothing. The perpetrator appeals to the universal desire to see, hear, and speak no evil. The victim, on the contrary, asks the bystander to share the burden of pain.\u201d This quote reminds me that the purpose of an advocate is to share the burden. And if I don\u2019t call this out, even in my small corner of the world then I am doing exactly what the perpetrator wants. A perpetrator is a perpetrator, whether or not their political opposition has more sexual assault allegations against them. And a survivor is a survivor, regardless of whether you like them, whether the person that hurt them is someone you look up to or whether they disclosed this experience 10 years or 10 minutes ago. Believe ALL survivors. When it\u2019s inconvenient and when it\u2019s scary. Because when you don\u2019t stand for the victim, you are standing for the perpetrator and every moment we question the validity of a survivors\u2019s experience is another moment we perpetuate and reinforce rape culture.#ibelievetarareade #tarareade #abuse #believesurvivors #believewomen #recovery #endrapeculture #rapeculture #consent #sexualviolence #sexualabuse #sexualassault #patriarchy #intersectionalfeminism #feminism #metoomovement #timesup #rapeapologists #trauma #victimblaming #whyididntreport #craftivism #embroidery #embroideryhoop #typography #fibreart #fibreartist","659":"Cops are fucking cowards who need to be killed.

I\u2019m not going to say I\u2019m sorry to you for what happened, because I know where the true apology needs to come from, the person that did it. It just makes me feel bad when people apologize to me. I will say that I\u2019m glad you\u2019re still here, because I know how hard and difficult things can be.

Years of stalking gets away with some community service. Victims are often not even believed by the same system that should protect them. Saying a victim can't explain what happened to them with the evil act it was, because the abuser simply couldn't help it, just adds another layer of invalidation of the victim's trauma.It's victim shaming.It's retraumatizing the victim telling them they should have empathy for someone who destroyed their spirit. I tried to have compassion for both conditions mentioned here, for longer than deserved. I tried to help, in vain.Often the only redemption and way of understanding the atrocities is to dehumanise the inflicter.It took me many years and several abusers to find this out.I don't feel like going deeper into this. So for now I just want you to know you are allowed to feel whatever the flip you want about your abuser.You don't have to feel compassion for the compassionless.Ironically it's even the only way a narcissist might get to a point of introspection, when everything around them falls apart. When there is no public compassion for them anymore, no validation, no supply.So if you want to help narcs, treat them like the shit they are and treat you like. \ud83d\udca9@NarcissismAwarenessNetwork\u26d3\ufe0f#NarcissismAwarenessNetwork","788":"I'm so proud of you.

I was placed in a group where our topic was sexual assault. In America, 1 of every 6 women has been a victim of an attempted or completed rape, and 1 of every 10 rape victims are men. Only 5 out of every 1,000 perpetrators end up in jail. Of all these sexual assault instances, about 8\/10 of those assaults are perpetrated by somebody the victim knows, whether it's on a date, a family member\/family friend, or a co-worker\/boss. The American justice system is not built to protect the survivors, and the process of bringing a perpetrator to court is long, complicated, and invasive.

So please everyone feel free to drop your thoughts. It might be worth keeping in mind that most, if not all, child molesters have strong traits of narcissism going on. I do agree with you an abusive situation with a minor is totally different from one with an adult, it is next level insane to take advantage of that. But I don't think every adult nessecarily has a choice, at least until the abuse is recognised as such. Before finding out about narcissism I had no clue what was happening and felt as stuck as a helpless child or animal. The narcissist would emphasis on this too, how I shouldn't complain comparing to these more defenseless groups and how I should just leave if it was that bad. Having dealt with both the scenarios I found the not molesting narcissist being at least, if not more wicked, than the other. Therefor for me it doesn't feel extreme to make the comparison. But I can see how it could. Because in a sense he was right, I could just leave, where if I was a dependent child I simply couldn't even if I wanted to. Point is being more that if a pedophile is worse and we wouldn't excuse them by saying they are helpless in their mental illness, why would we excuse someone doing less insane harm by saying they can't help it because they're mentally ill. If anything the molester should be excused by insanity then. Maybe it's a bit extreme too black and white cause there are a lot of gradations in general narcissistic behavior and not so much in molestation to put them side by side. I do hope it mainly illustrates how abuse shouldn't be excused. But you are totally right it's the victims responsibility to heal and overcome.

Men and women have different issues surrounding sexual assault that both deserve attention. For example, women get sexually harassed in the workplace, particularly by men in power, by far greater numbers than men. That\u2019s pretty much a gender-specific issue for women. Giving that issue attention isn\u2019t downplaying the sexual harassment of men. In the same vein, sadly, people don\u2019t really care about men getting raped, especially in comparison to women. For example, many people view the rape of men in prison as just, funny, and \u201cpart of the punishment\u201d. That\u2019s a male specific issue. Similarly, with the #MeToo movement, women are more empowered to come out about their sexual assaults, which is wonderful, but that has not happened with men. Everything about our culture and gender dynamics and socialization tells men to be strong and that the rape of men is emasculating and not a big deal, leading many people to deny that it\u2019s happened, suppress it, or just never speak up about it. Giving that issue attention isn\u2019t \u201chijacking\u201d anything, it\u2019s important, and silencing it is a part of the problem.","966":"@teensforpeace  thankyou. I'm trying.

But what you need to understand right now is that you need to love your body and yourself foremost. As unfair as it sounds, after a certain point, parents too are people who are secondary. They might have given you life and resources but you can't give in to everything they say because of that. You are your own person and you need to recognize that. People can be hurtful but when there's no one to pick you up, you pick yourself up. I know it might seem a little difficult rn but trust your choices. Your decision to take psychology. It's a very promising career path and if you wish to help others through this career, you have to help yourself first. You need to sit behind your driving wheel and take control for your life. Your body, your life and your career are your own. They are what you think about it and not what others do. What others say is a mere reflection of their thoughts that have nothing to do with how you actually are. I won't deny the difficulty in the path but you WILL eventually learn to ignore their criticism, life does get better. Trust me. I have been EXACTLY where you are right now and you will be surprised to see how much of a difference it makes when you start believing in yourself. Your struggle is real but so will be your success. Keep at it and you will get through \u2764\ufe0f. Much love.

However, it was quickly invaded when someone reported before me (with good intentions) but then starting a viscous cycle of EVERYTHING happening after. It was a reoccurring force and requirement  of more invasion. I was nothing but a prop from beginning to \"end\" ( it will never end). I was criticized and picked apart for many  things, including the time period between the assault to reporting. The one thing I counted on for survival and a hint of coping. Needless to say, the system failed as well. The system was just as invading and cold as the assault itself, over and over and over again.","1292":"I can\u2019t believe somebody is bashing her, I have not seen that.

She writes about two societies and brings out her views as of how misogynist and patriarchal these societies were. While I am not an expert on post Elizabethan western society I have some idea about the ancient Indian culture. While it is undisputable truth that women are not sexual and dumb creatures, the writer mentions that this is how women were thought of in the ancient Indian society. As a proof of this she mentions about Sita and Draupadi, powerful women but who, according to the writer, were victims of a misogynist society. She mentioned that Draupadi made a supreme sacrifice by marrying five men due to the fact that she feared that the rest four kauntiyeas would lead life of sages. While this would attest to the fact that she loved all the five pandavs, however it must be remembered that it wasn't a first type of setting. As mentioned by Krishna, such marriages had happened before, both polygamy and polyandry were practiced in ancient times. And we must remember that this marriage was not only sanctioned but also encouraged by krishna himself, so there is no doubt that this was an honourable marriage and polyandry an acceptable setting. The writer also mentioned that Draupadi went through fire for purification and regaining her \"virginity\", while I don't know what source she uses to make such a statement, I must say that this is utter BS. And to add my two pennies, the whole point of Mahabharat was Draupadi's \"apman\" at the hands of karuravas. It wasn't just a blown up civil war but a vengeance for the insult of Draupadi. The very theme of Mahabharat is feminism, if someone insults a woman, he\/she is adharmi and must be punished for it. We must remember that the cost of insulting Draupadi was paid by the whole of hastinapur with its destruction. And if someone misses that out and picks up segments facts to prove the misogynist nature of the society then I can't help with the mental faculties of that person. Also people also seems to miss the amazing fact that the people in mahabharatan society were known by the name of their mothers.","1304":"I was 12","1305":"True","1306":"@lexidelvie thats awful :(","1307":"Same for me.

Denn Feminismus ist nicht immer gleichzustellen mit einer Gruppe durchgeknallter, lesbischer, M\u00e4nner hassender und unrasierter Aktivistinnen (selbst wenn das in einer toleranten Gesellschaft auch ok sein sollte\u2026). Feminismus darf auch nicht immer mit der Opferrolle verbunden sein. Viele denken n\u00e4mlich, dass eben durch den Feminismus die Frau in eine Opferrolle gedr\u00e4ngt wird. Diese Rolle existiere jedoch gar nicht und der Feminismus sei daher \u00fcbertrieben. Denn wir leben ja in einem Land, in dem eine Frau das Sagen hat. Nach dem Grundgesetz sind M\u00e4nner und Frauen in Deutschland gleichgestellt und haben dieselben Aufgaben und Pflichten privat wie beruflich. Schlie\u00dflich gehen auch M\u00e4nner seit 2007 in Elternzeit.
