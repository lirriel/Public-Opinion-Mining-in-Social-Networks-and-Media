I'll copy-paste a comment that I just left in another thread:Circumcision only causes no harm if you assume the foreskin and its functions have no value to its owner, which you simply cannot do on behalf of all men.  I could also justify routine double mastectomies, which would eliminate breast cancer and save half a million lives every year, if I disregard the value that breasts have to women.Regarding putting FGM in another category...again, that's cultural bias talking.Type IV FGM, which is performed in Indonesia and is the most common form of FGM worldwide, removes nothing from the girl's body.  [A study found](https://knowledgecommons.popcouncil.org/departments_sbsr-rh/34/) that 92% of Indonesian mothers support the practice, and only 2% say it isn't beneficial.  In Egypt, where the forms of FGM are more severe (Type I), [82% of women support continuing the practice](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3134892/), with a majority responding that it doesn't lessen sexual pleasure.  In Africa, [an anti-FGM task force](https://www.taskforcefgm.de/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/hast81.pdf) claims that in cultures that cut women:1. *\"Research by gynecologists and others has demonstrated that a high percentage of women who have had genital surgery have rich sexual lives, including desire, arousal, orgasm, and satisfaction, and their frequency of sexual activity is not reduced.\"*  - *\"Many women who have had genital surgeries view the procedure as a cosmetic beautification, moral enhancement, or dignifying improvement of the appearance of the human body. This is true of both male and female genital modifications in African cultures.*\"2. *\"The widely publicized and sensationalized reproductive health and medical complications associated with female genital surgeries in Africa are infrequent events and represent the exception rather than the rule.\"*3. *\"Female genital surgeries in Africa are viewed by many insiders as aesthetic enhancements of the body and are not judged to be 'mutilations.'\"*4. *\"Female genital surgery in Africa is typically controlled and managed by women. Similarly, male genital surgery is usually controlled and managed by men. Although both men and women play roles in perpetuating and supporting the genital modification customs of their cultures, female genital surgery should not be blamed on men or on patriarchy.\"*5. *\"Demographic and health survey data reveal that when compared with men, an equal or higher proportion of women favor the continuation of female genital surgeries.\"*The truth is, in cultures that cut girls, FGM is justified in a myriad of ways, often by the women in those cultures. There are also some health benefits:http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1113&context=iph_theseshttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/265824402_Female_Circumcision_and_HIV_Infection_in_Tanzania_for_Better_or_for_Worsehttps://www.jsm.jsexmed.org/article/S1743-6095(18)31387-0/abstractWe could justify FGM fairly easily. All we have to do is disregard a woman's right to bodily autonomy, and ignore the value a woman might place on these body parts.Likewise, for male circumcision, there are absolutely still people who still practice it to this day in an effort to curb sexual pleasure.  I've saved a list of quotes from Jewish leaders, since that hits particularly close to home for me:* [Chabad](https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1014930/jewish/The-Mitzvah-of-Circumcision-Part-I.htm) (Major Jewish organization)> It weakens sexual desire and pleasure, hopefully giving a person more  strength to restrain himself from engaging in forbidden sexual  encounters. In a similar vein, Nachmanides writes that the *brit* reminds us to only use the male organ in a permissible and positive way.* [Rabbi Jonathan Sacks](http://rabbisacks.org/the-eighth-day/) (UK chief rabbi)> Circumcision symbolises the idea that there is something higher than nature. Passing on our genes to the next generation should not simply be a blind instinct, a Darwinian drive. The Abrahamic covenant was based on sexual fidelity, the sanctity of marriage, and the consecration of the love that brings new life into the world.* [Ritual Well](https://ritualwell.org/ritual/blood-and-men) (Canadian Reform rabbi)> Circumcision functions not only as ritual initiation but also as the communal ritual setting of boundaries to male sexuality. At the brit milah male blood is the metaphor for discipline and control over the ultimate male lack of control: unbounded and dangerous sexuality.* Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan (from link above)> The covenant of circumcision was one of the things that elevated Abraham and his children from the fallen state resulting from the expulsion from Eden. As a result of this covenant, the sexual act of the Jew enters the realm of the holy, and partakes of man's optimum state before his expulsion.* [Jewish Agency](http://archive.jewishagency.org/nechama-leibowitz/content/23929) (largest Jewish organisation)> Accordingly, this precept fulfills an educational and disciplinary role in the relationship of man towards his Creator. It harbors a permanent warning against the sinful use of the organ of reproduction: it elevates carnal activity to the level of a mitzvah… (The article then goes on to approvingly cite Maimonides and others who praised sexually repression by circumcision)* [Times of Israel](https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/brit-milah-pinchas-and-cyprus/)> ...his reproductive organ is not simply going to be used for pleasure or Darwinian reproduction. Instead, it will be used to continue the divine relationship from gen...eration to generation. When we mark our 8-day-old sons’ male reproductive organs, we are passing them the obligation to use their reproductive will in the service of the divine relationship. We are instructing them, almost from birth, that they are responsible for the proper use of their reproductive will.* [Commentary magazine](https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/the-new-enemies-of-circumcision/)> Where much of contemporary American culture now places the highest valuation on pleasure, especially sexual pleasure, and on the avoidance of any sort of pain, the classical Jewish texts value the willingness to suffer for a worthy cause, speak of the sanctity of marriage, and elevate self-control over self-expression.* [Aish ha-Torah](https://www.aish.com/jl/l/b/What_is_Circumcision.html)> In addition, *Brit Milah* is done specifically on the site that is identified with our greatest physical desires, thus empowering us to rise above the demands of our bodies.* [Reform Judaism website](https://reformjudaism.org/learning/torah-study/lech-lcha/brit-milah-jewish-answer-modernity)> Judaism, on the other hand, is in many ways a rebellion against nature. Yes, we are told to care for the natural world, but we are also told to work hard to make it better―to repair it. \\[...\\]And that's why religion tries to control nature. Judaism teaches that the world as God gave it to us isn't good enough―we need to perfect it. Nature makes illness; we must find cures. Nature wired us with all kinds of base desires; we must control them. In nature, most of God's creatures behave like animals; we must be better.* [Moshe Friedman](http://nymohel.com/laws_customs.php), NY mohel> By physically removing the foreskin, we are spiritually removing and eliminating undesirable character traits, depressive tendencies and so on. We eliminate from the body of the child, forces which might try to cultivate overindulgence in physical pleasures, etc.Few other links: [1](https://embassies.gov.il/holysee/Relations/Pages/Corporeality.aspx), [2](http://www.jtsa.edu/the-mitzvah-of-circumcision), [3](https://www.vosla.org/brit-milah-naming), [4](https://torahclass.com/archived-articles/835-jewish-identity-and-the-torah-part-1-by-rabbi-baruch), [5](https://www.dallasobserver.com/news/prime-cut-6401547), [6](https://www.orthodox-jews.com/what-is-a-bris.html), [7](http://www.britpro.com/default.asp?p=bris), [8](https://www.brismilah.org/press/prime-cut-dallas-observer/)We've created a false dichotomy in the west based on comparing the most extreme consequences of FGM with the most palatable excuses for MGM.  In reality, FGM encompasses a broad spectrum of practices, for a variety of reasons and with a variety of outcomes, and much of the justification we apply to male circumcision is echoed by FGM proponents.To respond to some of your specific points:> most male circumcisions are done in hospitals or sterile environment with clean medical cutting tools, while most female genital mutilations are done out in the open with dirty non-medical cutting toolsWhy does the setting matter?  If a girl were circumcised in a hospital, would that suddenly be okay?  (Edit: according to UNICEF, [one in four FGM procedures were performed by a healthcare provider](https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/approximately-1-4-fgm-survivors-were-cut-health-care-provider).)Also, every country that cuts girls with \"dirty tools\" also cuts boys.> the equivalent to removing the foreskin in females would be the clitoral hoodThis is form Type Ia of FGM:https://www.who.int/teams/sexual-and-reproductive-health-and-research/key-areas-of-work/female-genital-mutilation/types-of-female-genital-mutilationAre you okay with removing a baby girl's clitoral hood if it's done in a hospital setting?", "sentiment": 0}, {"text": "[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/lwfdj7/why\\_arent\\_we\\_allowed\\_to\\_have\\_interests/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/lwfdj7/why_arent_we_allowed_to_have_interests/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)", "sentiment": 0}, {"text": "Pretty good movie!

I was told that they really liked me, bit I needed evidence that I registered for the draft, and gave me the online address to ask for it. So I did.A few days later I got a call from Selective Service asking why I needed this. Apparently everything went online about 15 or 20 years before, but the older stuff was warehoused off-site. When I said it was for the IRS, they said something like, oh, yeah, they don't mess around. We'll send out to the warehouse and verify so we can send the document you need.Long story short, it took about a week for this to happen, and in the meantime all the positions they were hiring for were filled, mostly by women, who weren't held to the same standard. The people I interviewed with apologized and said they'd probably be hiring again in a year and I should apply again then.So, I missed out on a job opportunity because I had to jump through a hoop that many of the other applicants didn't, and the hoop was even higher for me due to my age.", "sentiment": -1}, {"text": "A much needed W", "sentiment": 0}, {"text": "Report her for sexism to the PTA as it's a private school.

I think the world at large has gotten better about recognizing that eating disorders are not (wholly) about appearance, that every person has their own reasons behind their eating disorder.The thing that annoys me about the portrayal of anorexia is that it doesn’t seem to get any attention until the affected person is deathly thin. Eating disorders have a lot of bad health consequences, and short of dying of starvation, you don’t have to be shockingly underweight to suffer those consequences. When I was younger I was also diagnosed with bipolar II, though recently that diagnosis has changed to generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and depression. My own emotional immaturity, not understanding my own emotions, and the interplay of the two disorders probably contributed to the diagnosis of BPII and many years of heavy medication. So that’s another thing people don’t always know: these diagnosis typically aren’t set in stone, particularly if you were diagnosed fairly young, as I was. As far as daily life, I cannot recall a time where I was not anxious. Even  my earliest memories are tinged with anxiety. I’ve had suicidal thoughts on and off since I was an adolescent. As a result my view of “normal” is skewed. My anxiety is probably around a 5-6 on a low anxiety day (like on vacation, or a lazy Saturday). It’s not until I get to a 7+ that I start to notice it. I’m scoring on a 1-10 scale where 1 is no anxiety, 10 is pure out-of-the-blue panic attack.  If I’m below a 4, it feels weird. It feels like something is wrong. The easiest way to describe how my anxiety typically looks is to give an example. Most recently it was my covid vaccine. Initially planned on getting it as soon as I was eligible. Then I had people around me starting to pressure me to get it before I was eligible. When I feel that kind of pressure, I push back. I avoid. So then I decided I wasn’t getting it. Then I started obsessing. The anxiety got so bad on a daily basis that I broke, and on first day of eligibility I signed up, with the caveat that if I couldn’t get an appointment that week, and my fiancé wasn’t allowed to stay with me during the shot, I wasn’t going to do it. My conditions were met, still about had a panic attack getting the shot (I hadn’t had any shot for 20+ years).  But I got through it, and got my second one last week. None of my hesitancy was about the safety or efficacy of the shot. I don’t think there are microchips or I’m going to turn into a zombie.  It’s about feeling like I am able to make my own decisions without outside pressure.So that’s usually how it manifests. Have plan, feel backed into a corner I don’t want to be in, resist, obsess, then break as long as I can still feel like the driver of my own life. If I can’t, I double down.(If you know someone like me, the best advice I can give is back off. Let them know you’re available to talk if they want, but don’t try and force talk. If they do talk to you, try to be factual while a) acknowledging they are having anxiety and b) withholding judgement as much as you can.)", "sentiment": 0}, {"text": "Better public transit.

It's actually cyberbullying.", "sentiment": -1}, {"text": "One thing that I absolutely love is how assault is a man's problem because \"most assaults are done by men\"... and in the meantime we absolutely DO NOT give a damn about manipulation, psychological abuse, etc, that are acts of violence that are a lot more available and common for women. And yet, it's absolutely ignored; to the point where gaslighting someone is usually seen as \"acting on one's own freedom\" and that's it. Let alone manipulating someone into something.It's easy to have one-sided violence when you cherry-pick what matters as violence, and encourage other bad behaviour in the name of freedom. A vast majority of gold-diggers are women; let's say women to teach each other not to do it.That's not how it works? How strange. I've seen way too many women constantly using others as they see fit and discarding them without any issue, while being encouraged for it because \"you go girl\" to the point where even someone asking for basic respect was seen as outrageous and going against one's personal choices. Some of these situations resulted in suicide attempts because it was done on people they already knew were weak psychologically. But this isn't considered \"violence\". Meanwhile, innocent men are supposed to be \"nice\" enough to take the blame and do all the legwork when it comes to women's safety (I thought it wasn't women's job to work to make things better for men? Don't things apply in the same way in reverse?). While abusing others psychologically is pretty much seen as a non-event, at least when it comes to women.That's one of the things that sicken me the most in this society: cherry-picking what counts as \"violence towards others\". A man is a criminal for doing something as terrible, trigger warning, as looking at someone, but someone constantly lying and gaslighting others, while throwing them away like handkerchiefs once they're not useful anymore, is fine and is just \"personal freedom\". Either you really care about morality or you don't. And if you do, maybe it's time to take into account what is bad and abusive behaviour but isn't considered as such nowadays. It's a bit too easy to constantly ignore how one's action can ruin someone's psyche or life just because there was no punch involved (despite the fact that for men, said punch will be a crime even if it was self-defense).Yeah, sure, it's easy to lay the blame of any societal violence on ONE target when you cherry-pick what counts as \"violence\". Meanwhile, if some men are scared of female manipulation and decide not to meet one-on-one, they're ALSO blamed for being scared despite women having a lot more power when it comes to ruining your life either socially or psychologically, given how society works.Punching/killing someone is terrible. No question about it. But I always find it funny to see how other behaviours, that used to be, a fairly long time ago, seen as reprehensible, that can be just as dangerous and dehumanizing are all fine and dandy. And strangely enough, it's the kind of \"violence\" that is the most common for women. Funny how this works.According to this stupid comic, men absolutely are justified if they avoid contact with any and all women and refuse to associate with them, no matter how much it bothers them. Manipulation and psychologic abuse coming from women are a serious concern as well; and a concern that isn't even recognized by our society which makes it even more insidious; someone can mess with your head and make you suicidal, make you think that you're unworthy of the air you're breathing and that you shouldn't kill yourself, not because of yourself but because your blood would taint the poor wall behind you (a kind of message that I've heard multiple times from many friends), and it's all fine and dandy, it falls under the \"freedom\" category for these people. And that's not going into other problems, like manipulating men via lying into committing violence onto someone else. At worst, this person will be seen as a jerk. But it's not seen as \"equal\" as direct violence. Thus creating a disparity.Again, it's easy to twist violence numbers when you cherry-pick your \"violence\". An hypothetical country without any gun existing in it wouldn't have any gun-related death neither. It wouldn't say anything about any other case of death that isn't any better morally. And since these people are always trying to argue from a \"moral high ground\"... The hypocrisy.Okay, then from now on all men should \"cancel\" women because the the risk of manipulation, gaslighting or abuse that is involved (and at least physical violence is punished; this almost never is in comparison, particularly when the perpetrator is a woman), and this isn't \"misogyny\", it's keeping any risk factor at bay.

They should be legally compelled to find work that pays a living wage or else the payments will continuously get smaller and smaller.

The problem might arise from how to interpret 'force appropriate to the danger'. It is generally assumed that women are weaker thus they can't represent a real danger to men, thus men using physical force is never appropriate to the danger a woman can pose to them, but that is a very harmful thinking based on gender stereotypes. Women can and in some cases do pose a threat to men, and if you are in that situation you have the right to defend yourself as good as you can, and if it's necessary, you can use force for that.

Not exactly about witches, but it is tangentially about the patriarchy, and how it effects me as a 29 year old heterosexual man. Over the last few years I’ve been coming to terms with the effects that toxic masculinity has on our society, including myself. It’s come at an unexpected cost though. throughout my adult life most of the women I’ve become romantically attracted started out as friends who over time exhibited qualities I would love in a partner. I’ve never acted on them in the past mostly for fear of rejection and also because I didn’t want my friends to think I only got close with them for the sole purpose of sleeping with them, which is definitely not the case; physical attractiveness is such a small part of what leads me to catch feelings. So I always let these attractions go and eventually the friendships fade in some of the cases. In all this I’ve learned that I’ve stopped trusting myself when I’m attracted to someone because I’m worried about the attraction being for the “wrong reasons.” as a result I’ve never fully learned how to approach the subject of romantic attraction with people who I’m attracted too and have been in an almost perpetual “unrequited love” mindset, weary of become a “nice guy” who thinks he’s owed something from the women he’s attracted to. There’s someone I like now and I really want to learn that I can trust myself with my feelings for her and that it’s not purely driven from a sexual attraction (although that’s there too.) I reaaaaallllly don’t wanna fuck this one up because she has every quality I’ve been searching for in a partner. she’s also very much awakened to her divine feminine and very perceptive, and I’m sure she senses my attraction to her.  I guess I don’t really have a question as much as I’m just looking for reassurance that being attracted to a friend isn’t inherently toxic and maybe ask for some direction on how to approach the subject of m romantic attraction with a woman who can see through everything.*edited to add clarity.", "sentiment": 0}, {"text": "I have the exact same pattern on a dress!

I get to some people might feel temporarily 'empowered' to choose when to show off their body but what they are ultimately doing is objectifying themselves for the visual pleasure of others. They are doing it for the likes, for the attention and for the praise and with only fans - for the money. Is something that is done entirely for the public praise of doing it ever truly 'empowering'? I don’t buy that its done for the individual posting it - because why post to a public forum.. just BE naked or pose sexy, on your own if it is just for you. I think maybe we have gotten caught up in an idea that anything women do is inherently okay because 'feminism' and to raise a point against it is somehow anti-feminist. I think onlyfans and sexual provocation/nudity on social media devalues the female form, the brain of the woman, the achievements of the woman. And not just the women in question it devalues either so I think it goes beyond 'personal choice' but it also perpetuates that mentality of objectification... that women should be attractive and sexy and alluring etc etc etc I think it just flies in the face of everything feminists have tried to achieve for the female sex. You don’t see top CEOs or high achieving men like Elon Musk, Jordan Peterson, Joe Rogan slapping their balls on Instagram and say it makes them feel good about themselves (for this to make sense you also have to imagine a world run my women who constantly objectify men’s balls - and use them to sell almost everything to the masses). Now, I’m not a prude, I have my insecurities but I am pretty much always naked at home and I don’t entirely mind if someone outside sees me, I’m not trying to be seen but I’m pretty comfortable being naked at home, I’d skinny dip in a heart beat, ive had naked drunken baths with friends and I love nudist beaches so this opinion isn’t coming from the perspective of someone who is necessarily just skin shy. I was, however, abused as a child. Possibly from before the age of 4, a time which I have no memory of. and I can’t help but think that the oversexualisation of women is a key factor in men treating women in the disgusting ways that they sometimes do. It is because they do not see them as equal, in cognitive or social or physical ability and I think when we push our tits together in a forever21 tank top with an arched back and a bit of side bum showing with some cheap ass caption of ''feel like an empowered woman, hbu?' it makes a f\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* mockery of actual empowered women striving to make a big difference in this world and cutting through the corporate male dominated world where men’s heads are swimming with this kind of lurid imagery every time we give a presentation, host an event or lead on a business deal.

I think the issue is there is no room for discussion on serious topics. I have always been a trans ally, always felt strongly about equal rights. Here in Ontario, we have self-ID. I was supportive of self-ID, although it was kind of pushed through as law without the public knowing. There is a case here, where a man self-IDd as a woman, and was put in a low security prison.  When he was released, he started identifying as a man again. Here is the issue- while in prison, there were reports of him harassing inmates for sex, hitting on them, Intimidating them - and he sexually assaulted inmates. One has come forward and laid charges against him.  This was a huge eye-opener for me. While I support transwomen, actual transwomen, some laws started with good intentions are being abused - by MEN. It gives transwomen a bad rep.  When I try to discuss this very serious issue, I am shut down being called a bigot and TERF. Blocked before anyone will listen.  There needs to be reform with this law to protect women from predatory men.I get so upset, that female victims are being silenced on this issue, and so called feminist disregard these victims in  place of virtu-signally.It upsets me, that our media is keeping this case quiet - there is a narrative and nothing can question it.As feminist, we should be able to discuss all issues women face, without being bullied into silence.  Transwomen should be listening imo, bc these men are going to destroy all the work for equality that older transpeople have fought hard for. Having the public finally understand the pain of dysphoria, just to have sick men use their rights for their own sick, twisted ways.  None of our msm will report this case. This happened at a prison near me, and have spoken with other women who were housed with this man, and heard their experiences. All I have asked was for a discussion to find a compromise that keeps both transwomen and cis women safe from predatory men, and that makes me a.bigot apparently.

I’m a 24 year old male pursuing a doctoral degree in healthcare, and during my education I’ve taken feminist theory, philosophy of sex and love, psychology of interpersonal dynamics, and some other classes on administration. In addition, throughout my college experience I’ve had met people that are in relationships that are harmful to them, people that are victims of abuse, and been in bad relationships myself. Some of these people I’ve met are by best friends now, but it took years to build trust or enable them to change their mindset to one that is healthy enough to be independent. The perspective I’ve gotten from that experience has shown me a few things that can help you navigate what you are talking about. The most helpful thing is to model positive relationships. When a person has an abuser (this could even mean an unhealthy relationship, including those that enable patriarchal behavior) in their life, they need a support system because they are victims. We need to show them kindness, allow them to talk about their problems, and let them know we love them exactly as they are. People do not respond well to being told what to do, even when we view the solution (such as breaking up) to be clear. When we tell a distressed person what to do or think, we model the same behavior that the abuser is using. “It’s normal for men to see strippers and you are a prude for not letting me” is along the same line as “you should break up with him because he is wrong and hurting you”, even if I agree with the latter statement much more. By using terms like “if he is breaking the boundaries of your relationship, what do you think is a way to clarify to him that you need different things” and “you are not “that girl”, I think you are wonderful and everything you’re saying makes sense. I’m going to be here for you no matter what you decide to do, and will help you through it” are much more empowering statements that encourage communication and problem solving, while also demonstrating care and respect. I’ve found you can never tell someone to break up with their partner, but you can demonstrate that there is better love out there, and make them feel supported enough to make the jump of ending a relationship (which is REALLY scary because no one likes to feel alone). Over time, the person feels enough support to be able to make that life change because they have you. It takes time, but by being there for people and loving them you are doing good. Eventually, people do ask about what I believe, why I have been there for them, and when those questions come out a real foundation of meaningful friendship can be made. Sometimes people continue to choose unhealthy men that can’t communicate or understand that relationships mean caring for another’s happiness, even if it means not going to strip clubs (these are the immature ones). Learning open and two way communication is really hard, especially when you’re 18. But you’re learning it, and it’s a wonderful process that will create meaningful and  lasting relationships. Being there for people has been my way of finding meaning in my life, and I hope you can help your friends move on to better men that listen, care, and work toward mutual happiness and love.", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "I mean...

Why do people find it necessary to express this with the additional attack on men? I've seen so many people on Reddit, in the media, and other social media platforms, go from: woman was kidnapped and murdered to all men are dangerous/ teach men not to....... / yes all men/ and now: the police are sexist. I just can't get my head around it and I feel so alone in my opinions I'm starting to lose the plot a bit. And when I see seemingly pleasant posts paying respect for her with that dig at men attached, all I feel is that whoever shared it is virtue signalling and totally insincere.Whenever I see people mention how many men kill women, about sexism in the police, I want to explain that more men are victims of violence from strangers, and that the criminal system is hugely skewered in favour of women, not against them. Not that sentencing is the same as policing but you get my point. I don't comment this stuff out of respect for the lady who was killed, but these narratives are being perpetuated so much, at least in the UK.Why is it okay for men to be vilified in such broad terms and it be the popular opinion?", "sentiment": 0}, {"text": "Well 70% of kids that get killed by their family are murdered by their mothers and single moms commit the majority of child abuse", "sentiment": 0}, {"text": "Logically, you can group the issues of both men and women into the following categories:\\- Fairness of the written law\\- Fairness of the applied law\\- Societal fairness\\- Fairness of the money spent by the government\\- Fairness of the media/entertrainment industries portrayal of a certain sex\\- Fairness in educationThere are probably more categories, but the list is good enough for a post here.Now, I don't specifically advocate for equality, I advocate for fairness. Equality is just a special case of fairness, and I'm totally fine with implementing equality.However, the most fundamental equality is the equality in the written and applied law.But in (almost?) all western countries, women do have clear legal advantages both in the written and the applied law.Often, people argue that this is needed to compensate for other inequalities, and I think this is a cheap excuse.In my country, womens retirement age is lower than mens. The reason this is the case is, because in the past, women were usually younger then men when they married, so for both sexes to statistically retire at the same time, women just got gifted a few years more retirement.Military is another obvious example, where men are legally forced to partake in military service (or pay a compensation fine) and women get a free pass. Often people respons with \"then we should abolish the army, or make it voluntary\". Imho, that's cherrypicking. IF you support equality AND you are against mandatory military service, you should support military service for women if there is the abolishment of the mandatory military service is not going to happen. You can then still advocate for abolishment of the military service.And that's only a tiny bit of the inequality in the written law.The next thing is the application of the law.As far as I know, and correct me if I am wrong, men get harder sentences for the same crimes.For example female pedophiles regularly get a slap on the wrist, because \"the 13 year old boy should be glad that he had sex with a hot teacher\" or something along the lines.Funny enough, both men and women judge women more lightly according to studies I've read (but again, I could be wrong), so as long as there is a human factor, the disadvantage of men in the application of the law will never fully vanish.That's why, I would love to have a judicial system that basically determines the sentence for a certain crime statically and only let judges decise in previously unknown edge cases.I skip societal fairness, because that's way to complicated of a topic, I think you could write books about it. But also societal fairness is basically made by society, which means it's democratic, it changes if we change, and forced changes will never work, only ever backfire.So let's get to an easier topic, tax money spent on a certain sex.I don't want perfect 50/50 split here, because men and women are biologically different, which must be reflected in the money spent for health care.But when men pay twice the amount of taxes in their lifetimes (that's a guess, I don't know the exact number, but it's afaik a big difference), but get half the amount of money, because they both work longer and die earlier, it's kind of unfair to a level nobody who seeks equality can support.There's many things like that, and one important example is that governments support academic feminism, which is not scientific but a lobbying group for feminist interests. There's nothing generally wrong with grassroot lobbying for your own interests, but it's criminally corrupt when you get tax dollars for it.And then there is the media/entertainment industries portrayal of men and women.Let's for example look at the female ghost busters movie. The assistent is not only a man, but he's absolutely stupid. Is that how feminists perceived the female secretary in ghost busters? I don't think so, because she was smart and strong.Truth is, men get portrayed as stupid idiots that can't do anything right until women do it for them very often. This is NEVER EVER the case for women.But I also dislike the portrayal of women in the media. For policital reasons they are sometimes portrayed as so extremely great, that the plot makes no sense anymore, because everybody else becomes just useless and insignificant. They become totally characterless. You can't even enjoy movies anymore like this. This was the case in star wars. The consequence of this is not even in favour of women, because the viewers, both men and women, get annoyed and start to be sceptical of moview with female leads.Also there was never a reason for it. We had great female leads for decades and everbody liked it. Take Kill Bill, Alien, Mulan, Star Gate and many others as examples. They were not woke, they were just women with character who filled their role to make their movies/series better.And that was only about the entertainment industry, the media isn't exactly neutral too.Ant the education is another hot topic.For decades we were trying to encourage women, because they were less educated for historical reasons that they didn't cause.And now, men are less educated. What are we doing as a reaction? Still encouraging women and downplaying the issues of men... how that makes any sense to anyone escapes me.And we know for decades how you could easily improve mens performance. Competition, Cooperation, Gamification and more physical movement in between.So why don't we do it? I don't know.

What does \"dropping out of society\" mean? Who exactly are the men who are \"dropping out of society\"? It seems that according to the author dropping out of society means not paying taxes/paying fewer taxes because they say that >if men start \"dropping out\" of society in large numbers, tax revenues will decline. We don't know what men the author talks about, and because of that, we can't decide if this claim is true or not. In the US, the employment rate is increasing since 2012, both for men and for women and slightly more for men (Source: OECD). So this data contradicts the claim that men are dropping out of society in the sense that they are dropping out of the labor market. It is surely true for some segment of men, and it would be useful to talk about them, but this argument is so generalizing that it doesn't support constructive discussion on the matter. And at this generalized level, this claim is not even true (it is not true in the EU either, I don't know about other countries). The author gives two reasons for men dropping out of the labor market. One is the loss in economic opportunities leading to the middle class, the other is the changes in the institution of marriage. For the first, they say, that>many of the roads that led to the middle class have been closed. Entire industries have been crated up and shipped overseas. They say that because entire industries relocated overseas, many of the economic opportunities to maintain a middle-class life disappeared, which caused a decline in male employment. It may be a case in certain areas, but not at others. To decide if it is true or not, we should have an exact context. Again, this claim is just too generalized to spur a fruitful discussion. The second reason is that > marriage has been gutted to the point that a spouse can be better described as \"a roommate you have to pay a fortune to have evicted.\" What? You don't have to marry if you don't want and what is the relationship between marriage and losing jobs? The argument seems to imply that men losing jobs because they have to pay in case of divorce. I can't comprehend this argument. Divorce laws may be bad, even biased against men, but how does it affect the employment status? Then the argument goes on to suggest areas to consider regarding this decline. The first is that > The overwhelming majority of government revenue is *collected from* men. This is just not true. In the US, 66.3% of men and 54.5% of women were working in 2018 - they all paid taxes. More men work, but it's not an overwhelming majority. In the EU, 54% of all working people were men and 46% were women. This doesn't seem like an \"overwhelming majority\". (Source: Eurostat)The second area to consider is that> The overwhelming majority of government benefits are *collected by* women. The overwhelming majority are collected by families and children. It is sad that mostly mothers have custody of children, so they get to get the money given to the children. It depends on the country and state of course, but please let me know benefits only available to women and is not related to children (I don't live in the US, so there might be). And the third is that> The overwhelming majority of consumer spending is *controlled by* women. What do you mean by \"controlled\"? How do you measure it? It is a claim that is impossible to prove or disprove because of its vagueness. After stating that men are dropping out of society (which is not true at US level) and presenting three \"facts\" from which one is definitely not true, one is most likely not true but I could not find statistics on it, and one cannot be answered because of how it is phrased. And from these flawed facts, the argument concludes that social problems will arise. > if men start \"dropping out\" of society in large numbers, tax revenues will decline, entitlements will be cut, and consumer spending will fall. Also, birth rates will fall further, and given that our retirement programs rely on a large number of the young supporting the old, you have a recipe for trouble. The logic here might actually be true. So in a case when men start dropping out of the labor market, tax revenues will most likely decline. Because of that, entitlements may be cut in the long run. If there will be more unemployed men and also fewer entitlements, consumer spending would also fall and may cause lower birthrates. It does not necessarily happen that way, but I won't go more into detail, because it doesn't matter, because the very first premise is not true at the US level (i.e. men are dropping out of the labor market). So it may happen, but at the US level it doesn't seem happening. If the author is talking about other areas, specific regions, groups, etc. this may be true, but then we have to have a specific context and talk about that, which is actually a good, necessary and useful thing to do.", "sentiment": 0}, {"text": "I guess this was all pretty worthless.

Early practitioners were largely defendant-oriented (Herman 2005), church-based (Fromme 2007; Pavlich 2005) and driven by “… religious or progressive concerns for the fate of criminal defendants … ” (Herman 2005, p. 578) amid increasing crime rates and an increasingly punitive environment of harsher sentencing. Herman (2005, p. 579) argued that the absence of a strong victim voice has “… reproduced many of the same deficiencies as the traditional justice system in respect to victims’ rights”. In the early days, victims were not central to restorative justice. The profound nature of this absence was highlighted by Zehr’s comments at a New Zealand hui (Māori term for meeting) in 2002: “[I] t took me a long time to realize how deeply embedded the offender orientation is in so many of us, and in our concept of justice… ” (Jülich 2003, p. 45). The same critique could be made of the theory that emerged to support the practice of restorative justice. As Ashworth (2002) noted, theory development has tended to be led by practice. Victims’ voices were similarly absent...restorative justice has not addressed structural inequality, discrimination or oppression, neither has it resolved pre-existing power imbalances between victim and offender, in particular for those offenders and victims who have a prior relationship or are known to each other (Stubbs 2002), as they most often are in sexual violence. Also, it would seem that some restorative processes might have further re-victimized victims by misusing power and coercion or they have used victim-offender encounters for the benefit of offenders (Braithwaite 2002; Strang 2002). There is some concern, for example, that a reduction in the severity of penalties following participation in a restorative process may encourage offenders to assume responsibility solely to access lighter sentences...\"", "sentiment": 0}, {"text": "It's Lego.

The decision was made against the recommendation of the Robert Koch Institute, which is a government agency that researches disease control and prevention.The reasoning of our Minister-President, Markus Söder, is that the FFP2 masks will prevent an infection for the carrier of the mask as well as for their environment. That is true, if the mask is worn correctly.However, when I, a woman, wear a standard FFP2 mask, it is too big for my face. The mask is gaping at the chin and nose, even when using one of those masks with a metallic strip in it. Today, I noticed that I am not the only woman with this problem. The masks are gaping for all women I saw, while they do not gape for men. With my FFP2 mask, I am practically raw dogging train air. With the community mask I sewed myself, I never had this problem.My assumption is that the size of the masks are standardized to fit onto men's faces, as so many things are in our world. I am now stuck with buying special FFP2 masks made for my face, which will cost me more money.

Second, marriage has been gutted to the point that a spouse can be better described as \"a roommate you have to pay a fortune to have evicted.\"As far as the decline goes, reflect on the following:* The overwhelming majority of government revenue is *collected from* men.* The overwhelming majority of government benefits are *collected by* women.* The overwhelming majority of consumer spending is *controlled by* women.In short, if men start \"dropping out\" of society in large numbers, tax revenues will decline, entitlements will be cut, and consumer spending will fall.

She didn’t explicitly say anything (of course, this could’ve been because it wouldn’t have been worth her trouble), we continued to talk afterwards, and she didn’t appear hostile, but I couldn’t help but feel that I might’ve made her uncomfortable. I genuinely feel terrible and contrite about what I did.I initially considered what I did to be a disrespectful and embarrassing faux pas, and something from which I should learn to refrain from such behavior in the future. Yet for whatever reason I began to dwell uncontrollably on what I did, and with each instance of contemplation my perception of my action worsened.I should preface by explaining that in the past I've had tics that compel me to do things I otherwise shouldn't do. One such example consists of looking at my feet a total of four glances while I'm driving, precisely because I know I'm not supposed to. Similarly, when swimming underwater, I feel compelled often to open my mouth and let water in four times, as I know that it would be best not to do so. These tics may seem trivial, but they have been natural for me for a long time.Such tics have been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. I say this not to convey that these tics have made my life unbearable—they have not; rather, my purpose is to explain that these tics have become normalized for me. I’ve always suspected there may be an attention deficit component to these tics.When I was young, I developed a similar tic-like habit whereby I would look at private parts. This eventually developed into something where I knew I wasn’t supposed to do something, but precisely because of this I felt compelled to do it anyway. I don't know why this tic in general developed. Was it due to the frequent thoughts about sex I had when I was 6/7? Was it due to innocuous portrayals of such behavior in movies/TV? I’d feel the need to steal glances at a private area a total of four times, in general. This urge has been there not just with women’s décolletage, but also with mens’ crotches at times, or women’s legs. This is especially true when I’m engaged in conversation with someone. This urge-driven tic wouldn’t necessarily always be there in every single interaction, but through some interactions it would be there.It’s not that I deliberately try to leer or to make people uncomfortable. I don't openly stare, for instance, at a woman's chest for 10 seconds with wide eyes while drooling. I've never made comments, or touched, or tried to take up someone's personal space. I’m not trying to prey on people, or to try to impose myself on them sexually. For whatever reason, it's like when talking to a woman for extended time, it's hard for me to keep still in general. My eyes wander haphazardly, and combined with this tic, this happens.And yet my reasons should not matter as much as the effects of what I did to her. She covered her shirt, and odds are good I made her feel uncomfortable. In the moment, I ascribed what happened here to my tic, and judged that I had been rude and disrespectful at worst, and that if I learned from this, I could move on. But over time, my dwelling in this became far worse. She'd continued talking to me during that conversation, and she wasn't hostile, true. But what was she not showing me? How can I be sure exactly how bad I made her feel? Maybe I ruined her day. Maybe I ruined her whole week. Maybe I made her feel less of herself. Maybe I've affected her life immutably. Are these exaggerations? Am I obsessing over this to an unreasonable degree, or are these possible, reasonable ramifications of what I did?Furthermore, I began to fear that maybe, whilst I'd believed that I was never openly leering/ogling at people, what if I'd been wrong ever since I'd developed this tic? How many countless women could I have potentially made uncomfortable? No one has ever prior indicated that my presence made them uncomfortable. I've never been reported for anything even remotely minor. And yet I feel I can't be sure. I remember now just one other instance, from when I was younger, when a girl at school covered her shirt while I was talking to her. This is the only other time covering shirt had occurred. Was this due to my tic too?As I read stories of people like Morgan Freeman, Bill O'Rielly and their workplace sexual transgressions, I see small, maybe if only tangential, similarities between what they did and what I did. Men like this have commented in women's figures in the workplace, touched their skirts, asked them how they 'feel about sexual harassment.' These transgressions seem to me patently wrong and inexcusable. And yet another thing they've been accused of is leering women up and down. Coupled with their other systematic patterns of behavior, it seems as though this leering should be construed as further attempts to make women uncomfortable in the workplace. And although I've never been party to these other types of behavior, I can't help but feel peripherally associate with these men.Ultimately, I cannot ascertain for certain to what extent my actions in this instance stemmed from normalized tics, and to what extent it arose from subconscious irreverence for her person. I have little doubt that what I did stamp largely from a dependence on my normalized tics. Yet if I submitted to this tic, is this not the same as being irreverent to her person? Maybe I am no better than a Morgan Freeman/Bill O'Rielly.I've been hoping that the fact that she may not have even noticed, or likely forgot about what happened soon thereafter, may mean that I should get to move on if I promise to do better. But why not take this logic to completion? If a man rapes a woman, and she was too drunk or incapacitated to remember it, does this make him any less of a rapist? By the same logic, would her forgetting this make me any less of a harasser? Of a predator? I understand that to conflate rape with looking at cleavage would be disingenuous at best and malicious at worst—that's not my purpose. My purpose is to test this line of logic.I cannot live with myself thinking of myself as a sexual harasser. This label has been weighing on me for months at this point. I can't eat properly, and can't get assignments done, I'm hardly sleeping. Sound funny, or facetious? I'm being genuine. I am deeply sorry for what I did, and I understand now not only that what I did was wrong, but also why it was wrong. I am cognizant now of how differently women can perceive objectification, and that, even if my tics become difficult to resist, this is no excuse at all for disrespecting someone else's person. But I can't go on thinking of myself as a sexual harasser. I just can't.There are only two ways in which I could deviate from this course of action, either by rationalizing my actions or by and living with myself that way, or by accepting what I did, which would—even if only slightly peripherally—place me in a category of individuals with whom I am unequivocally unwilling to be associated. To commit to the former path would be to lead my life with unconscionable dishonesty; the latter, to undergo such a radical change in self-perception for which I have not the strength.There is no impartial mediator to help me guide my thoughts. I had one feminist friend who told me that I'm overreacting. Yet I'm confident that there would be other people who would say I'm not overreacting. But if one person thinks I'm a sexual harasser, there must be legitimacy to that, yes? If I'm even .5% associated with a group of people including Freeman, O'Rielly, Ansari, etc. I can't live right myself.I have virtually no concern with being potentially reported for sexual harassment.

There's a thin line between sharing your honest feelings and inadvertently making a person with clinical depression or thoughts of self harm feel even more like a burden -- not exactly what you want to do.There's just very little practical information or support for the day to day issues of caregiving, especially where mental health is concerned. What do you say or do when someone you love is having a panic attack? Expressing suicidal thoughts at 3am on a Wednesday? How do you help ensure a fellow adult takes extremely necessary medication consistently if they struggle with routines and patterns? How do you balance all of this with a demanding job and being the primary manager of all household labour? What does it do to your own mental health, and how can you balance the functional responsibilities of caregiving with the responsibilities of your own health, mental or physical? Who knows? Maybe you can figure it all out with the three 30min \"well-being\" hotline sessions your employer allocates each year? The stigma around mental health is a huge issue, primarily for helping people manage their own and to seek help when they need it. But the secondary impact is that caregivers *also* feel ashamed and secretive, because 1) it may not feel like their own issue to 'share' with others, especially mutual friends and acquaintances, and 2) it's impossible not to feel like people will doubt you or simply conclude that you made poor relationship decisions somehow.

We truly love to see it! In a sign that Biden is doing something right, one of the executive orders he issued on Wednesday night has pissed off a cohort of some of the worst people in the world—TERFs and other supposed feminists who have made it their mission in life in recent years to loudly fight the expansion of trans rights. Meant to tackle “discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation,” Biden’s executive order essentially calls on federal agencies to broadly apply last year’s landmark Bostock ruling, which expanded the definition of sex discrimination to include discrimination based on sexual orientation as well as gender identity. Notably, the executive order included the line, “Children should be able to learn without worrying about whether they will be denied access to the restroom, the locker room, or school sports,” and stated that Bostock should also apply to Title IX, the federal law that prohibits discrimination in federally funded schools.This has major implications for trans students, and signals an extremely welcome shift after the Trump administration, which marshaled the considerable resources of the federal government to make the lives of trans people as mean and limited as it possibly could. “It is such a relief to have a government that is committed to preventing discrimination as opposed to enabling it,” wrote the ACLU’s James Esseks, the director of the group’s LGBT & HIV Project, in a statement in response to the executive order. As the National Women’s Law Center’s Gillian Branstetter told Jezebel via email, Biden’s executive order “is a critical recognition of both last summer’s [Bostock] Supreme Court victory and the right of every person to learn, labor, and live without fear of prejudice or bias.”BIDEN, THEY CROAKED, IS “ERASING WOMEN.”But the move hit differently for all those who have spent recent years cloaking their transphobia in a shallow concern for women and girls. Biden, they croaked, is “erasing women.”The Women’s Liberation Front, or WoLF, a small group of so-called “radical feminists” who have partnered with the religious right to campaign against trans rights, wrote that Biden’s executive order “is a disaster for women and girls in the U.S.” and an “unprecedented attack on women’s rights and civil liberties.” Abigail Shrier, the writer whose book title—Irreversible Damage: The Transgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters—tells you all you need to know about her, jumped in with her own hyperbolic take, which was retweeted widely. “A new glass ceiling was just placed over girls,” warned Shrier darkly, adding that the executive order “unilaterally eviscerates women’s sports.” Even the Brits decided to weigh in; in a since-deleted tweet, the writer Hadley Freeman bemoaned that Biden’s move was “terrible,” adding later that it “will kill women’s sport.”That this fretting is actually anti-trans fearmongering hidden under the guise of a warped and outdated notion of feminism should be apparent. But the handwringing does, in its own way, acknowledge the potential repercussions that Biden’s executive order represents. As many have noted, it may give the many Republican legislators who are pushing bills targeting trans high school athletes a bit of pause, given that Biden’s executive order signals that the Department of Education may move to revoke federal funds from states that pass discriminatory laws against trans students. As the ACLU’s Chase Strangio put it, commenting on Montana’s bill being debated on Thursday that would bar trans girls from athletics, “The legislature is playing games with the state’s education system to attack trans young people.” He added, “Right now lawmakers are not only voting on trans lives but threatening the state’s federal funding.” Financial consequences, after all, seem to be the only ones that bigoted state lawmakers ever care about.", "sentiment": 0}, {"text": "What about solo porn where a woman just masterbates on camera ?", "sentiment": -1}, {"text": "My aunt and uncle are both doctors who work at the same place doing the same thing and they get mail addressed to Dr. & Mrs. Last Name all the time.", "sentiment": 0}, {"text": "My brother just got back from uni recently, I haven’t seen him in 7 months because of covid (and I’m pretty thankful for it.

That's delusional self deception.Listen, if you want to call yourself a feminist, I don't care. I've been investigating feminism for more than 9 years now, and people like you used to piss me off, because to my mind all you were doing was providing cover and ballast for the powerful political and academic feminists you claim are just jerks. And believe me, they ARE jerks. If you knew half of what I know about the things they've done under the banner of feminism, maybe you'd stop calling yourself one.But I want you to know. You don't matter. You're not the director of the Feminist Majority Foundation and editor of Ms. Magazine, Katherine Spillar, who said of domestic violence: \"Well, that's just a clean-up word for wife-beating,\" and went on to add that regarding male victims of dating violence, \"we know it's not girls beating up boys, it's boys beating up girls.\"You're not Jan Reimer, former mayor of Edmonton and long-time head of Alberta's Network of Women's Shelters, who just a few years ago refused to appear on a TV program discussing male victims of domestic violence, because for her to even show up and discuss it would lend legitimacy to the idea that they exist.You're not Mary P Koss, who describes male victims of female rapists in her academic papers as being not rape victims because they were \"ambivalent about their sexual desires\" (if you don't know what that means, it's that they actually wanted it), and then went on to define them out of the definition of rape in the CDC's research because it's inappropriate to consider what happened to them rape.You're not the National Organization for Women, and its associated legal foundations, who lobbied to replace the gender neutral federal Family Violence Prevention and Services Act of 1984 with the obscenely gendered Violence Against Women Act of 1994. The passing of that law cut male victims out of support services and legal assistance in more than 60 passages, just because they were male.You're not the Florida chapter of the NOW, who successfully lobbied to have Governor Rick Scott veto not one, but two alimony reform bills in the last ten years, bills that had passed both houses with overwhelming bipartisan support, and were supported by more than 70% of the electorate.You're not the feminist group in Maryland who convinced every female member of the House on both sides of the aisle to walk off the floor when a shared parenting bill came up for a vote, meaning the quorum could not be met and the bill died then and there.You're not the feminists in Canada agitating to remove sexual assault from the normal criminal courts, into quasi-criminal courts of equity where the burden of proof would be lowered, the defendant could be compelled to testify, discovery would go both ways, and defendants would not be entitled to a public defender.You're not Professor Elizabeth Sheehy, who wrote a book advocating that women not only have the right to murder their husbands without fear of prosecution if they make a claim of abuse, but that they have the moral responsibility to murder their husbands.You're not the feminist legal scholars and advocates who successfully changed rape laws such that a woman's history of making multiple false allegations of rape can be excluded from evidence at trial because it's \"part of her sexual history.\"You're not the feminists who splattered the media with the false claim that putting your penis in a passed-out woman's mouth is \"not a crime\" in Oklahoma, because the prosecutor was incompetent and charged the defendant under an inappropriate statute (forcible sodomy) and the higher court refused to expand the definition of that statute beyond its intended scope when there was already a perfectly good one (sexual battery) already there. You're not the idiot feminists lying to the public and potentially putting women in Oklahoma at risk by telling potential offenders there's a \"legal\" way to rape them.And you're none of the hundreds or thousands of feminist scholars, writers, thinkers, researchers, teachers and philosophers who constructed and propagate the body of bunkum theories upon which all of these atrocities are based.You're the true feminist.

Now we have a different problem, since society sees sexual assault as a women only issue, men are not taken seriously when they report that they themselves were victims, some men get raped but don't report because they got brainwashed into thinking that men can't be raped. People use this to say \"see, they're so many more female victims of sexual assault, so the problem is men\". The reality is more complicated, it is reasonable to think that more women gets sexually assaulted but it could be a proportion of 80/20 or even 60/40, we won't know until more studies goes out. But obviously, studies about male victims of sexual assault don't get a lot of funding.Also, I'm talking here about official criminal statistics, a lot of feminists \"research\" use self-revealed surveys, that often blur the line between sexual harassment and sexual assault. They also tend to give those surveys to populations that are more exposed to those behaviors (young college women, for example) and they generalize to whole study saying that \"it's about ALL women\".Anyways, feminists and society at large would benefit from a class of criminology.", "sentiment": -1}, {"text": "I read that too.

The best that can be achieved is risk reduction and this is accomplished by society and the individual: both have responsibilities over the outcome. For example, the local Council is usually responsible for ensuring paths do not have significant tripping hazards, but it is the individuals responsibility to ensure they do not contribute to the risk themselves with loose shoelaces or not looking where they are walking.The world is a dangerous place: you might believe you are entitled not to be harmed in any way, but that is a false expectation. So what do we do with the fear that everything out there is potentially going to harm us?The reality is that actual harm is naturally mediated by circumstance including motive, means and opportunity. If we look at statistics of harm, any individual generally has a very low risk of experiencing serious harm and although the risk increases for less serious harm, it is still usually quite low and also the impact of that harm is less.Based on the low probability of harm and the very low probability of serious harm, our fears should be much lower than believing everything out there is going to harm us and maybe low enough that living our lives, even in the presence of some harm, is a risk we are willing to take versus the certainty of harm in not living our lives if we isolate ourselves from the world outside. However, it requires rational moderation of our own emotional impulses for our fears to be put into perspective and proportion and unfortunately, for whatever reason, some elements in our community are stoking emotional impulses instead of rational moderation.Society and the individual can further reduce risk by ameliorating the circumstantial factors of motive, means and opportunity. Deliberately making ourselves helpless to defend ourselves by becoming intoxicated, for example, increases opportunity for harm.Deterrents can act as a motive modifier, but only in circumstances where rational moderation of emotional impulses is engaged: they are relatively ineffectual if an action potentially resulting in harm stems from a strong emotional impulse or impulse moderation is compromised. That's why crimes of passion tend to ignore punitive laws: angry people ignoring Apprehended Violence Orders for example. In terms of outcome, relying on deterrents to minimise all crimes is counterproductive as it generates a false sense of security: punishing harm is little comfort, after the fact, when the harm has already occurred. Far better to aim for prevention as much as that is possible. Unfortunately our system is setup almost entirely based on deterrence through punishment.", "sentiment": 0}, {"text": "It really is gross how many people say KAM, it makes me feel ill.", "sentiment": -1}, {"text": "Because unlike literally all the female/feminist subs, this sub doesn't ban like it's going out of style.", "sentiment": 0}, {"text": "What do you say to the people who argue that making this decision for a child that can't consent isn't an issue because it is morally equivalent to something like religious indoctrination (or upbringing for a more neutral term), or that this logic at least leads down the road of suddenly looking at parents making decisions for their children in general as child abuse.When my step dad's brother argued this, I felt kind of out of my element.

You're not the director of the Feminist Majority Foundation and editor of Ms. Magazine, Katherine Spillar, who said of domestic violence: \"Well, that's just a clean-up word for wife-beating,\" and went on to add that regarding male victims of dating violence, \"we know it's not girls beating up boys, it's boys beating up girls.\"You're not Jan Reimer, former mayor of Edmonton and long-time head of Alberta's Network of Women's Shelters, who just a few years ago refused to appear on a TV program discussing male victims of domestic violence, because for her to even show up and discuss it would lend legitimacy to the idea that they exist.You're not Mary P Koss, who describes male victims of female rapists in her academic papers as being not rape victims because they were \"ambivalent about their sexual desires\" (if you don't know what that means, it's that they actually wanted it), and then went on to define them out of the definition of rape in the CDC's research because it's inappropriate to consider what happened to them rape.You're not the National Organization for Women, and its associated legal foundations, who lobbied to replace the gender neutral federal Family Violence Prevention and Services Act of 1984 with the obscenely gendered Violence Against Women Act of 1994. The passing of that law cut male victims out of support services and legal assistance in more than 60 passages, just because they were male.You're not the Florida chapter of the NOW, who successfully lobbied to have Governor Rick Scott veto not one, but two alimony reform bills in the last ten years, bills that had passed both houses with overwhelming bipartisan support, and were supported by more than 70% of the electorate.You're not the feminist group in Maryland who convinced every female member of the House on both sides of the aisle to walk off the floor when a shared parenting bill came up for a vote, meaning the quorum could not be met and the bill died then and there.You're not the feminists in Canada agitating to remove sexual assault from the normal criminal courts, into quasi-criminal courts of equity where the burden of proof would be lowered, the defendant could be compelled to testify, discovery would go both ways, and defendants would not be entitled to a public defender.You're not Professor Elizabeth Sheehy, who wrote a book advocating that women not only have the right to murder their husbands without fear of prosecution if they make a claim of abuse, but that they have the moral responsibility to murder their husbands.You're not the feminist legal scholars and advocates who successfully changed rape laws such that a woman's history of making multiple false allegations of rape can be excluded from evidence at trial because it's \"part of her sexual history.\"You're not the feminists who splattered the media with the false claim that putting your penis in a passed-out woman's mouth is \"not a crime\" in Oklahoma, because the prosecutor was incompetent and charged the defendant under an inappropriate statute (forcible sodomy) and the higher court refused to expand the definition of that statute beyond its intended scope when there was already a perfectly good one (sexual battery) already there. You're not the idiot feminists lying to the public and potentially putting women in Oklahoma at risk by telling potential offenders there's a \"legal\" way to rape them.And you're none of the hundreds or thousands of feminist scholars, writers, thinkers, researchers, teachers and philosophers who constructed and propagate the body of bunkum theories upon which all of these atrocities are based.No...You're the true feminist.

I am a man, and I have rarely been sexually harassed by men, despite being in the theater program, in which only one other man is straight. I have been sexually harassed and assaulted by a few different women, one of whom showed me porn, flashed me and about four other people her tit,  twerked on a guy that I know, tried to twerk on me, and grabbed my dick, all while having a boyfriend at the time..

Sexual aggression is not related to sexism, it's related to feelings of power, which women want just as much as men.&#x200B;To be clear, I am not anti-feminist. I just think that many feminists do not know the challenges that men face, and rape of men not being taken seriously is one of the worst things about being a man.  Male rape victims have been ridiculed, told to \"Man up\", and forced to pay child support while their rapist gets to keep the child.

If you want it done, ask a woman.\" - Margaret Thatcher Things like vocal fry, ending sentences as questions?  and verbal qualifiers (\"is it just me, or...\" and \"that's just my opinion\" and literally saying \"I don't know\") are all noted throughout feminism as women consciously and unconsciously playing into their role within a heteronormative patriarchal capitalist society. To observe and report as a female that \"doesn't know,\" is less qualified, silent + pretty, \"knows her place,\" and, most importantly is there solely for men's pleasure and servitude is to continue to reinforce that patriarchy, *whether she is aware of it or not.*The women who have had to fight to be heard as equals, especially in the workplace, have been doing so for decades.Unequal pay has zero to do with any \"modesty\" and everything to do with patriarchy. For the .77 cents a white woman makes, a woman of color makes .40-.65 of that same dollar.

It's the normal use of the term.If someone uses men/females or man/female it is inherently sexist. It's dehumanizing in the same manner that calling a Black person \"a Black\" is dehumanizing. They literally take the personhood away from individuals or groups they consider beneath men. Both men and women can be misogynistic and can consider women beneath men just like anyone can be racist, internalized misogyny is really common. So even if a woman uses it doesn't make it \"not sexist\". There's no free pass here.If someone uses male/female or females/males in the same place it's not necessarily problematic but really if someone can use the terms for human male and human female that are Woman/Man correctly why not use them?Tldr: Male/Female should be used as an adjective to indicate gender specifically.Woman/man should be used as a noun for it's intended purpose human male = man, human female = woman.PS: it's particularly striking in some other languages where no one would dream of calling a woman by a term usually reserved for biology or other species of animal.

A private investigator followed me around a few times and tried to question me and people I knew about me to get dirt on me. I was bullied really badly in high school and got into drugs and drinking. Lost a lot of friends and my family split. In the end one guy was plead guilty and was given 3 years (only because he was 26 and had raped 10 other girls, most minors) and the other got off with nothing. He ended up walking around town with a knife trying to find me but the cops got him and I had a restraining order put against him.

By doing them instead of being afraid of being shamed. Women are essentially taking back the power of their bodies etc.*However*, there are ways it can be seen as there still being exploited.Women who share their nudes openly and willingly, or take part in porn (e.g. only fans) is pushed as being empowering. But ultimately, they're still just being sexualised by men. What women share will be used by men for sexual gratification. So is this not women still being sexually exploited but they're made to believe its empowering?The same can be applied to women being more open with casual sex. It is seen as empowering because they're taking control of their sexuality, they're defying the slut shaming and going out there and doing what they want.But then there is the orgasm gap between men and women, meaning when women hook up, they're likely to leave without ever having an orgasm, but he almost always finishes. So we say women hooking up is sexually empowering...but...they're not being pleased, only he is. So are women not just being exploited still, but we are just made to believe by society that it is something we want in the name of empowerment? *Conclusion* It all depends on your personal view of things.- women sharing nudes is sexually empowering because they're claiming back power.- women sharing nudes is sexually exploiting them still because those photos are going to be used for mens sexual gratification.

It has been wonderful, everyone I met try their best to be inclusive, and the company truly cares about diversity and equal opportunities and it shows.Except... I've started to notice that a colleague (Guy A) that works very closely to me (and also considered by me a not-so-close 'friend') tends to say discriminating things very subtly.I've had someone say something quite rude to me when I started work, and at that time I couldn't control my emotions (read: tears) so I just left the room. I'm in good terms with that person but this Guy A has been telling other people that he's scared to ask me for help because I'll react that way.If I look at myself objectively, I used to be hot headed sometimes, but gosh, I've never shouted, snapped, made a rude/snarky comment to anyone in the co. If anything I thought I adore the people I work with so I was always careful with how I react. If I feel like crying, I'll just walk out saying I'm unwell or something, although that never even happened twice.I try not to be too close to this guy despite us sharing mutual friends because of the kind of rude remarks he makes. He once got upset that someone said something 'feminist' during a large event (context - someone said thank you for including female characters in an exercise we were doing...). He downright asked me if I had plastic surgery (first person to ask me that). He told me my job and my role is not very core to the team while he's is. He believes in the 'girls bringing girls down' narrative and subtly tries to pit girls against each other by comparing their looks. He asks me \"how much did you buy *something \"fancy\" like a Starbucks drink*\" with a judgemental tone.But I've been noticing a more disturbing thing he's doing recently which is framing women around her who show emotions (negative ones especially) or speak up assertively as \"scary\" and hard to approach. I've also noticed that he likes girls who are super nice and smiley as friends and judges girls who may not smile all the time or express their preferences.Do I want to be his friend? I can pass. Do I want to confront him? Hard pass. But we have so many mutual friends and it's such a tightly knit community that I can't avoid him forever. Oh, and we work together.

This guard/guardian role of a father gives him a fertile ground for his covert aggression.

I am not one of you, don't message me.This is very difficult for me to discuss.I am a cis straight male, I was raised from the ages of 4 - 15 by a progressive feminist lesbian in central Indiana.She is the source of a lot of my progressive values, such as being pro-choice, secular, enviotmentalist, pro-animal rights, a supporter of the LBGTQA community, and feminism itself.I had attended many gay pride parades before my 12th birthday and I would volunteer at the AIDS hospice my mother worked at.I never, and still do not, felt any shame for being from a homosexual family. I wasn't educated that the world outside our home was not as liberal, especially after we moved away from Indianapolis, as my household was. Therefore I was unprepared for the instant isolation that came about when I revealed to my peers in the small central Indiana school that I had two mothers. It did not go well, I instantly became the target for homophobic bullies, including the closest thing I had to a best friend. I attempted to make new friends, but the stigma of being the kid with the lesbo parents stuck, till the only person who would still talk to me was the kid with the locker next to mine, I eventually stopped talking to any if my peers at that school after that kid showed everyone else the invitation to my 12th birthday party I had put in his locker (I was given over 30 and I only have out one), he and the rest were laughing at how \"funny\" it was that I would actually believe that anyone would accept such an invitation. Things got better when we moved to an even smaller town, but this time, armed with my past social disasters, I kept my home life secret, I even made friends and had a girl ask me out (though I was so surprised by this that I said no before I understood what she had said), even the bullies at the school liked me. Then the house we lived in was condemned due to very dangerous wiring and we moved again (I attended 21 different schools before I was 18), the bad thing was that we moved to the same school district I attended before.This was the death blow to my social life. I completely shut down, I never made another friend or girlfriend and became terrified of my peers, by the time we had moved once again, I no longer had any social skills, I did not know how to make friends, this was severely compounded by another big struggle of my youth.The progressive feminist lesbian parent that had shaped the very core of my value system and made me so liberal, was a severe misandrist.I know this is a horrid stereotype that is thrown out by misogynists, homophobes, and other far-right bigots, but she honestly was a very prejudiced woman, she had her reasons for being this way, she suffered horrific abuses by men in HER youth (I will not tell those stories, sorry, they are her trauma and it is not my place to share them).She would constantly insult all men, even gay ones, in the house, throughout my childhood. If she saw an attractive woman walking with a man, it would disgust her and she would rant about it at length. She took me and my sister out of our school (my sister was 8) because she firmly believed that my sister would be gang-raped by her classmates if she kept us in public schools (she quickly gave up teaching us and we went back to public school after yet another move).As I grew up she started directing her hate towards me. She would call me over to inform me that she and my mother were never going to break up, despite the fact that I had never said anything to the contrary, I loved her and didn't want any seperation, but she felt that I must have secretly wished this because I was turning into a man.She always treated my sister better, she forgave her mistakes and came down harsh on mine. I spent most of the time from 10 - 14 grounded, and even when I had friends, I was forbidden from staying at their house or inviting them over.She would still insult other people of my gender and sexual orientation, not caring about how this would affect me as the only male in the house. She would tell me that I was destined to be a horrible person because I was going to grow up to be a man, and once it became clear that I was straight, the insults and dark predictions got worse.She hated my father and would always fight against my mother to stop us from seeing him. She would often hit me, she threw things at me in anger, ince throwing a hard back book at me so hard that it dropped me to the ground and left a bruise that lasted for over a month on my left thigh, she treated me like I was born a sex offender, this made puberty even harder than it already was with how socially isolated I was.This crippled my self-esteem, depression controlled my life for over a decade before I started to understand the source of my mental health problems and work to combat them.I despised my gender, I could never talk to any girl or woman I was interested in because I believed that I was so far beneath them that nothing I could offer could ever be good enough for any woman to overlook the evil that was my gender. My sexuality was also a source of shame, I believed that it was wrong for women to be with men, putting another hurdle in my path to a romantic relationship.This woman is the source for both my highly progressive ideals and the suffocating self-loathing that still plagues my life.I have no friends, no partner either. The internet has helped me out alot in expanding my social life, I have discovered interests like anime and I am active in their online communities.However I still suffer from all the insecurities the hate I was raised with. As I write this I am both terrified and deeply depressed, I wasn't even going to write this tonight because the torment was overwhelming me.Now I do know the point of this subreddit, I do has something I want to ask.I have often searched for any advice on how to overcome the pains of my childhood, but I never make it far.There are two types of discussions regarding misandrists common online.Men calling all feminists radical \"Feminazis\", call same sex parents unfit, homosexuality is a sin, and all the various disgusting vomit everyone on this subreddit are already very familiar with.Then there is the other side, the side that is supposed to support victims of gender shaming, but they don't, look up misandry and the vast majority of results will be feminists arguing that men cannot be victims of gender oppression. Articles declaring that calling misandry hate speech is dangerous and that it will lead to a massive outbreak in violence against women. That acts of hate should be punished differently based on the gender of the victim.Some even say that hate crimes should not extend to acts against men.These are the top results, go to stories of men such as me that are victims of misandry and you will often see multiple angry responses from feminists that accuse the man of being the real bigot, that he should have thought of HER pain, that the very idea of men being the victim of sexism was laughable, that somehow the abusive woman could always be justified in any so called \"abuse\" she gave.I have attempted suicide.I have hurt myself due the still present depression, I go to therapy to help. When I see such views being so common and mostly unopposed by the feminist movement, it is VERY painful. It seems to confirm the hate I and many other men suffered from.Abuse that many boys today suffer from around the world.I can garuntee you all one thing, that if I had read any of these discussions when I was younger, my suicide attempt would have succeeded. They would have been the final plunge into despair and I don't see me having the strength to keep living.Now, there are men and boys out there today suffering far worse than what I experienced, boys like I was, scared to reach out, lacking any real support, boys that get pulled into the hate-groups of the far and alt-right after reading and hearing hate unabashedly spread about a trait they had no choice in.So here is what I want to ask feminists.If I nearly (very very nearly) took my own life out of feeling I was born evil, what do you imagine some boy that has suffered turmoil I can't fathom encounters these discussions? Especially if he is a progressive like myself, some one that supports feminism, equal pay, is pro-choice, and despises bigotry, traits that mean the only support for our emotional abuse mostly denies that abuse such as our can exist or even worse, attack us and perpetuate the feeling of self loathing instilled on us by our abusers, even going so far as to say they we MUST be the abusers, that are abuser was justified in what they did, that we just misunderstood.2nd question:Do you think that feminists need to work on recognizing misandry and being more welcome to those that seek aid after suffering as a result of it?I know it is hard. I know that the hate comes from men depressingly often.That the hate is far more prevalent on the other side and the fight to defeat the patriarchy is still very much needed.I know that victim mentality is EVERYWHERE among those, such as myself, with privledged positions in western society, but denying the very existence of male victims and trying to say that misandry can be justified is literally killing people. I garuntee that a boy or man has come here and other places like this seeking support and what they found led to them taking their own life. It almost happened to me.Please help me and others like me, progressives are supposed to be the better people, if we are who we say we are, then we should not be afraid to recognize our own failings and we should always work to end their influence.When a man comes forward and he believes himself to be a victim, do not assume that he lack understanding of victimhood. When a feminist denies the existence of misandry, we need to stop ignoring it.We are incredulous when we see the right deny misogyny, enforced gender roles, rape culture, other forms of gender inequality, racial injustice, religious intolerance, and all the various fucked up stances of the conservatives among us.They are blind to the extent hatred has infected their world, they declare the #MeToo movement as overblown, or believing Black Lives Matter to be the same as the Klu Klux Klan.Our side suffers from similar blindness of our own evils, it is far stronger than many of us are aware and ignoring it is literally killing people.This, writing this was very painful and I cannot avoid feeling dread of receiving a level of hate I can't cope with, but I truly feel this needs to be discussed, both for the unfortunate victims, and those among us that are blind to the pain and hate they are feeding.I hope you see me as a comrade in arms and not an enemy soldier, and understand that I tried very hard to not speak ignorance here, and can forgive me for anything I was wrong about.It is my sincerest desire that all of your days are as full of meaning and happiness as is possible and you have my deepest gratitude for reading my thoughts For ease I have repeated my queries below:1st question:If I nearly (very very nearly) took my own life out of feeling I was born evil, what do you imagine some boy that has suffered turmoil I can't fathom is both shunned from conservative society and vilified by progressive society?2nd question:Do you think that feminists need to work on recognizing misandry and being more welcome to those that seek aid after suffering pain as a result of it?", "sentiment": 0}, {"text": "You can check on wikipédia.

More specifically, the notion of woman as enchantress is one that recurs in images such as Circe Offering the Cup to Ulysees (1891, Oldham Art Gallery) and Hylas and the Nymphs (1896, Manchester City Art Gallery). His oeuvre also includes a number of middle-eastern subjects, in which he drew on the work of contemporary artists such as J.F Lewis (1805-76) and Lawrence Alma-Tadema (1836-1912), rather than on actual experience. This is one of Waterhouse's earlier works and reflects his fascination with the exotic.The woman in this picture appears to be a witch or priestess, endowed with magic powers, possibly the power of prophecy. Her dress and general appearance is highly eclectic, and is derived from several sources: she has the swarthy complexion of a woman of middle-eastern origin; her hairstyle is like that of an early Anglo-Saxon; her dress is decorated with Persian or Greek warriors. In her left hand, she holds a crescent-shaped sickle, linking her with the moon and Hecate. With the wand in her right hand, she draws a protective magic circle around her. Outside the circle the landscape is bare and barren; a group of rooks or ravens and a frog - all symbols of evil and associated with witchcraft - are excluded. But within its confines are flowers and the woman herself, objects of beauty.The meaning of the picture is unclear, but its mystery and exoticism struck a chord with contemporary observers. When the picture was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1886 the critic for the Magazine of Art wrote 'Mr. Waterhouse, in The Magic Circle, is still at his best - original in conception and pictorial in his results' (quoted in Hobson, p.37).", "sentiment": 0}, {"text": "I’m a former exotic dancer with an MA, a successful career and a side hustle in politics", "sentiment": 0}, {"text": "and all those sluggers went down like lead.", "sentiment": 0}, {"text": "So so beautiful 😍", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "Beauty 💗", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "This is beautiful!

He didn’t have much money, but he had a wealth of wild stories that he used to tell me from his younger days. He also loved poetry. Any topic that came up in conversation - he’d be able to recite something related. My favourite stories of his came from the time he spent in the USA and Mexico in his 20’s (1950’s).It’s a long story, but to break it down: he joined the Canadian army and went AWOL a few months later with some friends of his. They spent the next two years travelling south. He used to talk about how he worked at fairgrounds in Chula Vista and how he also visited a childhood pen-pal who worked on a ranch in Texas.Eventually he was arrested near the Mexican border and deported back to England. The police apparently assumed he and his friends were illegal immigrants... which they were...I guess, but just not from Mexico. As I said, it’s quite a long story.He passed away last summer. He’d had dementia for several years, and he had already forgotten who I was about 5 years ago. I was still sad that I couldn’t visit him in hospital due to COVID. The care home he was living in cruelly threw away all of his possessions the day after he died before my parents could go and collect his things. My Dad managed to salvage one of his poetry books and a framed photo from the tip. Everything else was gone or ruined.He didn’t have much money, but he’s left me just a little bit. From that I would like to get something handmade from the region of the world that he loved so much.

On one hand I can understand the need of uplifting an identity that is too often ignored or hyper criticized. But, I think that Beyonce being uplifted kind of shows the way that sexist and colorist ideals work within the black community. Beyonce would probably not be as famous if she was darker skin and didn’t play into the male gaze to sell her music. I also wonder how much her parents, getting into the business so young, and being apart of the rap/R&B scene during the era of misogynist rappers and singers such as R Kelly affected her own views.I was reading Demita Frazier (member of the Combahee River Collective) and her comments about Beyonce were eye opening. Frazier said that Beyonce is promoting sex positivity but if your a feminist the conversation should be ongoing and focus on other avenues as well such as devoting more money to educating young black girls or addressing misogyny in rap/R&B. Beyonce seems to have some feminist views but a lot of it seems clouded by overarching black liberation thinking (which still caters more to the liberation of black men).I wish the black community could uplift more females like Tierra whack or noname who talk about issues facing all types of black people without having to play into the jezebel stereotype that has haunted black women. But, too many people rather listen to artists who don’t really support the community which makes it harder to have conversations on issues affecting the community such as sexual violence. Also, we are already aware of how difficult it is for conscious black rappers and singers to make it in the mainstream because their thinkings have not been accepted by that same audience. I wonder why artists that only focus on sex, drugs, and money are more likely to be favored in mainstream society then people speaking about the obstacles they face like rap and R&B use to be.So, I guess the hate you received will probably be ongoing but just know that it is very common.

I'll follow a yoga video, with my favoutite channel being \"Breathe and Flow\".On Monday, Wednesday and Friday I do a full-body workout, which usually consists of five to six movements that incorporate the seven primal movements. Push, pull, squat, lunge, hinge (at the hips), twist and an animal movement (or walk/run). These full-body workouts are bodyweight movements or I'll add in fabric resistance bands (which I love) to make the movement harder. I'm not a fan of weights, though I applaud anyone that does them, that's badass.For cardio, I am not a fan of high-intensity cardio, I much prefer walks/hiking. So that's what I do, walking/hiking, and I'll always take my dog with me (I feel safer with her). I usually go for a 30+ minute walk in the afternoon. The one thing I love about a healthy lifestyle is that you can adjust it to what you want to do. If you don't like weights, don't do them. If you love yoga, do that! Maybe doing a sport is for you.
