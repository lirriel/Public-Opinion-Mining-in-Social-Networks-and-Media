I'll copy-paste a comment that I just left in another thread:Circumcision only causes no harm if you assume the foreskin and its functions have no value to its owner, which you simply cannot do on behalf of all men.  I could also justify routine double mastectomies, which would eliminate breast cancer and save half a million lives every year, if I disregard the value that breasts have to women.Regarding putting FGM in another category...again, that's cultural bias talking.Type IV FGM, which is performed in Indonesia and is the most common form of FGM worldwide, removes nothing from the girl's body.  [A study found](https:\/\/knowledgecommons.popcouncil.org\/departments_sbsr-rh\/34\/) that 92% of Indonesian mothers support the practice, and only 2% say it isn't beneficial.  In Egypt, where the forms of FGM are more severe (Type I), [82% of women support continuing the practice](https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3134892\/), with a majority responding that it doesn't lessen sexual pleasure.  In Africa, [an anti-FGM task force](https:\/\/www.taskforcefgm.de\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/07\/hast81.pdf) claims that in cultures that cut women:1. *\"Research by gynecologists and others has demonstrated that a high percentage of women who have had genital surgery have rich sexual lives, including desire, arousal, orgasm, and satisfaction, and their frequency of sexual activity is not reduced.\"*  - *\"Many women who have had genital surgeries view the procedure as a cosmetic beautification, moral enhancement, or dignifying improvement of the appearance of the human body. This is true of both male and female genital modifications in African cultures.*\"2. *\"The widely publicized and sensationalized reproductive health and medical complications associated with female genital surgeries in Africa are infrequent events and represent the exception rather than the rule.\"*3. *\"Female genital surgeries in Africa are viewed by many insiders as aesthetic enhancements of the body and are not judged to be 'mutilations.'\"*4. *\"Female genital surgery in Africa is typically controlled and managed by women. Similarly, male genital surgery is usually controlled and managed by men. Although both men and women play roles in perpetuating and supporting the genital modification customs of their cultures, female genital surgery should not be blamed on men or on patriarchy.\"*5. *\"Demographic and health survey data reveal that when compared with men, an equal or higher proportion of women favor the continuation of female genital surgeries.\"*The truth is, in cultures that cut girls, FGM is justified in a myriad of ways, often by the women in those cultures. There are also some health benefits:http:\/\/scholarworks.gsu.edu\/cgi\/viewcontent.cgi?article=1113&context=iph_theseshttps:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/265824402_Female_Circumcision_and_HIV_Infection_in_Tanzania_for_Better_or_for_Worsehttps:\/\/www.jsm.jsexmed.org\/article\/S1743-6095(18)31387-0\/abstractWe could justify FGM fairly easily. All we have to do is disregard a woman's right to bodily autonomy, and ignore the value a woman might place on these body parts.Likewise, for male circumcision, there are absolutely still people who still practice it to this day in an effort to curb sexual pleasure.  I've saved a list of quotes from Jewish leaders, since that hits particularly close to home for me:* [Chabad](https:\/\/www.chabad.org\/library\/article_cdo\/aid\/1014930\/jewish\/The-Mitzvah-of-Circumcision-Part-I.htm) (Major Jewish organization)> It weakens sexual desire and pleasure, hopefully giving a person more  strength to restrain himself from engaging in forbidden sexual  encounters. In a similar vein, Nachmanides writes that the *brit* reminds us to only use the male organ in a permissible and positive way.* [Rabbi Jonathan Sacks](http:\/\/rabbisacks.org\/the-eighth-day\/) (UK chief rabbi)> Circumcision symbolises the idea that there is something higher than nature. Passing on our genes to the next generation should not simply be a blind instinct, a Darwinian drive. The Abrahamic covenant was based on sexual fidelity, the sanctity of marriage, and the consecration of the love that brings new life into the world.* [Ritual Well](https:\/\/ritualwell.org\/ritual\/blood-and-men) (Canadian Reform rabbi)> Circumcision functions not only as ritual initiation but also as the communal ritual setting of boundaries to male sexuality. At the brit milah male blood is the metaphor for discipline and control over the ultimate male lack of control: unbounded and dangerous sexuality.* Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan (from link above)> The covenant of circumcision was one of the things that elevated Abraham and his children from the fallen state resulting from the expulsion from Eden. As a result of this covenant, the sexual act of the Jew enters the realm of the holy, and partakes of man's optimum state before his expulsion.* [Jewish Agency](http:\/\/archive.jewishagency.org\/nechama-leibowitz\/content\/23929) (largest Jewish organisation)> Accordingly, this precept fulfills an educational and disciplinary role in the relationship of man towards his Creator. It harbors a permanent warning against the sinful use of the organ of reproduction: it elevates carnal activity to the level of a mitzvah\u2026 (The article then goes on to approvingly cite Maimonides and others who praised sexually repression by circumcision)* [Times of Israel](https:\/\/blogs.timesofisrael.com\/brit-milah-pinchas-and-cyprus\/)> ...his reproductive organ is not simply going to be used for pleasure or Darwinian reproduction. Instead, it will be used to continue the divine relationship from gen...eration to generation. When we mark our 8-day-old sons\u2019 male reproductive organs, we are passing them the obligation to use their reproductive will in the service of the divine relationship. We are instructing them, almost from birth, that they are responsible for the proper use of their reproductive will.* [Commentary magazine](https:\/\/www.commentarymagazine.com\/articles\/the-new-enemies-of-circumcision\/)> Where much of contemporary American culture now places the highest valuation on pleasure, especially sexual pleasure, and on the avoidance of any sort of pain, the classical Jewish texts value the willingness to suffer for a worthy cause, speak of the sanctity of marriage, and elevate self-control over self-expression.* [Aish ha-Torah](https:\/\/www.aish.com\/jl\/l\/b\/What_is_Circumcision.html)> In addition, *Brit Milah* is done specifically on the site that is identified with our greatest physical desires, thus empowering us to rise above the demands of our bodies.* [Reform Judaism website](https:\/\/reformjudaism.org\/learning\/torah-study\/lech-lcha\/brit-milah-jewish-answer-modernity)> Judaism, on the other hand, is in many ways a rebellion against nature. Yes, we are told to care for the natural world, but we are also told to work hard to make it better\u2015to repair it. \\[...\\]And that's why religion tries to control nature. Judaism teaches that the world as God gave it to us isn't good enough\u2015we need to perfect it. Nature makes illness; we must find cures. Nature wired us with all kinds of base desires; we must control them. In nature, most of God's creatures behave like animals; we must be better.* [Moshe Friedman](http:\/\/nymohel.com\/laws_customs.php), NY mohel> By physically removing the foreskin, we are spiritually removing and eliminating undesirable character traits, depressive tendencies and so on. We eliminate from the body of the child, forces which might try to cultivate overindulgence in physical pleasures, etc.Few other links: [1](https:\/\/embassies.gov.il\/holysee\/Relations\/Pages\/Corporeality.aspx), [2](http:\/\/www.jtsa.edu\/the-mitzvah-of-circumcision), [3](https:\/\/www.vosla.org\/brit-milah-naming), [4](https:\/\/torahclass.com\/archived-articles\/835-jewish-identity-and-the-torah-part-1-by-rabbi-baruch), [5](https:\/\/www.dallasobserver.com\/news\/prime-cut-6401547), [6](https:\/\/www.orthodox-jews.com\/what-is-a-bris.html), [7](http:\/\/www.britpro.com\/default.asp?p=bris), [8](https:\/\/www.brismilah.org\/press\/prime-cut-dallas-observer\/)We've created a false dichotomy in the west based on comparing the most extreme consequences of FGM with the most palatable excuses for MGM.  In reality, FGM encompasses a broad spectrum of practices, for a variety of reasons and with a variety of outcomes, and much of the justification we apply to male circumcision is echoed by FGM proponents.To respond to some of your specific points:> most male circumcisions are done in hospitals or sterile environment with clean medical cutting tools, while most female genital mutilations are done out in the open with dirty non-medical cutting toolsWhy does the setting matter?  If a girl were circumcised in a hospital, would that suddenly be okay?  (Edit: according to UNICEF, [one in four FGM procedures were performed by a healthcare provider](https:\/\/www.unicef.org\/press-releases\/approximately-1-4-fgm-survivors-were-cut-health-care-provider).)Also, every country that cuts girls with \"dirty tools\" also cuts boys.> the equivalent to removing the foreskin in females would be the clitoral hoodThis is form Type Ia of FGM:https:\/\/www.who.int\/teams\/sexual-and-reproductive-health-and-research\/key-areas-of-work\/female-genital-mutilation\/types-of-female-genital-mutilationAre you okay with removing a baby girl's clitoral hood if it's done in a hospital setting?","48":"[https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskFeminists\/comments\/lwfdj7\/why\\_arent\\_we\\_allowed\\_to\\_have\\_interests\/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskFeminists\/comments\/lwfdj7\/why_arent_we_allowed_to_have_interests\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)","49":"Pretty good movie!

All they began as were European playing cards. They are still just European playing cards in many cases. I saw my first tarot that way, being used by my Spanish grandfather and his friends.Before the 1960s, late, all card reading was done with poker decks. Look for older books to tell you what stood for what. It's the reader, not the cards, doing the work. (Even if collecting decks is one of my weak points. Love the art.)For that matter, I've designed two decks. They are my faves. Get a source on what they're supposed to mean, and make cards with a symbolism that works for you, that you can remember. Can't make pictures? Composite symbols in graphics programs or with old-school collage. Redesign them as you understand more. Like you, it can grow and improve.","68":"Thanks, met some assholes in the store the other day, I needed this","69":"At work, I just always mimic back whatever people say, but I think when I'm out I'll spice it up a little <3","70":"It\u2019s their decision.

I talked to him to be friendly but eventually got creeped out. He would ask to walk me to and from school, he showered me with gifts, would tell on me to my parents if I didn\u2019t give him extra attention and would come over my house several times per day when I wasn\u2019t home and just sit outside or interrogate my family on where I was. He messaged me from every social media and made new ones whenever I blocked him (this was after my dad had to call the phone company and have his number blocked so he would stop texting me). He started having my friends leave me monster energy drinks during the school day, which I didn\u2019t even like. He even showed up at my moms work once to ask her how I was and she didn\u2019t even know him! I started seeing him stand outside of my house in the street sometimes just sort of wandering around outside my window and that\u2019s when I got suuuuuper creeped out. I went outside one day and told him I didn\u2019t like him and I was not ever going to like him with how he was acting. Next thing I knew he hated me and told all of our mutual friends I was a slut. By the time junior year came around he was still salty about it and occasionally I\u2019d hear rumors he had spread about me. Once or twice throughout junior\/senior year he messaged me saying he was sorry and still liked me. I saw him wandering outside my house a few more times. He offered to buy me more monsters, which I of course didn\u2019t want, and when I turned them down he would get so sad and say something like \u201cwell, maybe someday....\u201d. Ugh still creeps me out.","94":"My wedding dress","95":"\"Many people seem to think it foolish, even superstitious, to believe that the world could still change for the better.

You'll probably find many weird and illogical stuff on your first weeks. If you take notes about it, you can ask about it to better understand it  obviously, but that's not the true brilliant thing with this tip. People tend to do things out of habit and not question it, even if it's not always the most efficient way of doing it. With your fresh point of view, you can sometime notice those, and in a few month, find solution to improve it. It might take time, because you have to learn a bit more about how things work at your new job to get the bigger picture.

Also, your social skills can be  improved but you have to take away that self loathing and start respecting yourself and loving yourself without narcisism. I guess she is using as a emotional baggage to her vindictive  and hatred towards you. The question is how self aware is she that she is doing that to you? Do you ever talk to her about this ? Try to talk to her and be assertive ( no , I am not talking being agressive or screaming or anything of that . Rather that learn  to respect others while respecting yourselves.  This self hatred won't t let you improve as a person. It self sabotage you. The reason you are being bully is because you do not put boundaries ( I also struggle on that)  and people do not like pushovers and people who do not stand their ground due that is consider weakness. Worst this behavior atract toxic people into your life.  I suggest to go to a phsycology, find a hobby, read philosophy,  and reflect what life do want as person and create your own purpose.  In regard to your mother,  if she continues to mistreat you and still hating you because you turn a man. This going to be hard but cut her ties and give distance because from the look from it she is toxic for you and she is affecting negatively. Do not expect to change anyone or save anyone unless they willing to do so . In order to help somebody  , said person need to be their own help first and take responsibility to their life. I know you love because she is your mom but if you consider her being to much to handle then try to take distance to her. But this is merely my opinion and suggestion. Is is your responsibility and your choice not mine.  You can ignore me if you want .","127":"Hi. I guess i was just a little curious.

Feminism is about equality, not about WoMeN aRe BetTeR thAn MeN.

She argued that sometimes parent-child incest is not violation of children's rights, but denying the child's agency to consent to such relationships is the real violation -- \"the reification of the child's body as passive surface would thus constitute, at a theatrical level, a further deprivation of the child: the deprivation of the psychic life...so I keep adding this qualification : 'when incest is a violation', suggesting that l think there may be occasions in which it is not. Why would I talk that way? Well, I do think that there are probably forms of incest that are not necessarily traumatic or which gain their traumatic character by virtue of the consciousness of social shame that they produce....\" (p -- 157, Google Book) Sex positive feminists like Gayle Rubin, Patrick Khalifa, and others also defended pedophilia....compared pedo men's plight with the persecution of communists....were members of pedo organisations like NAMBLA and more.","134":"Where are the kings?","135":"Here's a great [video](https:\/\/youtu.be\/3K5zhjnHSGU) you might be interested in.","136":"Surely the ones having a problem should be the ones switching seats.

No matter how many times I explained it, he just kept trying to reword it and force us to do it. It was the only time in the wedding planning process I raised my voice at someone.","141":"The oppression of women is not because of the interests of little girls or the aesthetic tastes of young women.  For years, when I was on Facebook as a young mom, every Christmas there would be a TON of posts about STEM toys for little girls.  As if the fact that little girls liking dolls is the reason grown women are pushed out of leadership positions in STEM fields and face discrimination, harassment and toxic work environments.  Spoiler alert-the reason was men and misogyny.Telling women what they should and should not wear IS the problem.  Telling women what they can and cannot like IS the problem. Shaming women for wearing dresses or liking pink because they are \"brainwashed\" is NO DIFFERENT from telling women they need to have a \"bikini body\" or that their bra straps are too distracting for boys to see.Furthermore, \"masculine\" traits and interests ARE NOT BETTER IN ANY WAY than \"feminine\" traits and interests.  The ONLY reason you think that is because those traits were associated with masculinity\/femininity in the first place.  Pink is not a worse color than blue.  Pants are not better clothing than skirts.  Having short hair is not better than long.  Pretty and sparkly and fluffy and cute are not somehow demeaning to like.  It is beyond shameful and gross to judge and shame women for their genuine interests.","142":"Does Ted Cruz have worms for brains or what?","143":"This is a repost: the title is word for word.

Especially if you're a man, I cannot tell you how relieving it is to see men recognizing them and be able to call them out.The best advice I can give you is to listen to women. Listen and understand when they're frustrated and complaining about some misogynistic behaviour that bothered them. Then put that into practice and encourage your friends to do the same.If you really want to join something, it all comes down to where you live and what you do in life. If you're still in school, in most universities you'll find some kind of feminist group, you could start there.

Make it a criminal offense. Place the responsibility on the government to hold people accountable and put them in jail for attempting to ruin lives in such an emotionally, mentally, and socially devastating way-- Lord knows every falsely accused person gets the media smear campaign before they've even seen a judge, so why the double standard for the people who blatantly set out to destroy lives just because they can get away with crying \"rape\"?Jesus.

TL;DRboyfriend says he fully understands feminism but has done no research, and (i believe) is in denial of his internalized misogyny. idk how to talk to him about it. i\u2019d love to hear someone\u2019s thoughts and maybe just talk about it.","155":"And this is why I hate sex work and the rise of young women joining OF.

I remember in 2016, she started dating Chris Ray Gun and debated Blaire White. She still more or less held (and holds) the same POV in her videos, it\u2019s just that she\u2019s more interested in discussions and discourse. Is this why people hate her so much now? I\u2019ve seen multiple articles take more recent videos out of context, and it seems to me that several people read those articles and made their decisions based off that?

At the highest level we should all have equality.

But the distinction has as much to do with postmodernism as it does anything else.  Epstein bought a series of paintings by artist Maria Farmer depicting and exploring puberty. The paintings weren't intended to be erotic, but Jeffrey Epstein, whose predilections are now all public knowledge, projected a different set of values on her paintings.The same can be done in reverse.  Erotica can be reinterpreted and reclaimed as feminist empowerment.   Or not.  Depending on who you ask.

I very grudgingly did so.Thirty years later, in 2010, my employer announced they would be closing my local office soon. About the same time the IRS announced they would be hiring soon for jobs for the following tax season. I applied, got called to in to take an aptitude test, and was interviewed. I was told that they really liked me, bit I needed evidence that I registered for the draft, and gave me the online address to ask for it. So I did.A few days later I got a call from Selective Service asking why I needed this. Apparently everything went online about 15 or 20 years before, but the older stuff was warehoused off-site. When I said it was for the IRS, they said something like, oh, yeah, they don't mess around. We'll send out to the warehouse and verify so we can send the document you need.Long story short, it took about a week for this to happen, and in the meantime all the positions they were hiring for were filled, mostly by women, who weren't held to the same standard. The people I interviewed with apologized and said they'd probably be hiring again in a year and I should apply again then.So, I missed out on a job opportunity because I had to jump through a hoop that many of the other applicants didn't, and the hoop was even higher for me due to my age.","199":"A much needed W","200":"Report her for sexism to the PTA as it's a private school.

Let's look at your post history (and let's not even delve into the comment history). - how dare feminists say my not crying is TOXIC!- why can't feminists accept men as they are! How dare they call us toxic. X2- feminists are making male suicide a competition!- toxic femininity! Women always have to be the victim!!- Saying \"toxic masculinity\" is derogatory!!- APA is sexist against men for pointing out detrimental behaviours and outcomes!- women are more cooperative during conflicts with attractive men.- complaining about a post being removed on askfeminists- men are sexually assaulted as much as women! If you can't see that you seem hyperfocussed on women, and the fact that they dare to advocate.for women's issues, or suggest that some typical, old-school behaviours are HARMFUL to the men displaying them... while at the same time defending to the death those same toxic traits that likely contribute to your own mental health struggles. In one reply you say to me that your suicidal ideation is the result of feeling upset about *your mother* and how she is stuck in a home, about witnessing her rape and beatings... and then you get sarcastic and aggressive when its suggested you get some healing and closure by advocating against domestic violence, because HOW DARE one suggest you only focus on what happened to my mother. Youre all over the shop.","202":"being put in detention and calling the police is two different things completely separate from each other.","203":"It would be a completely secluded beach all to ourselves. Laying in the sand with a bunch of drinks in a cooler and an umbrella over me. Watching dolphins, swimming occasionally. Not too hot.

I think the world at large has gotten better about recognizing that eating disorders are not (wholly) about appearance, that every person has their own reasons behind their eating disorder.The thing that annoys me about the portrayal of anorexia is that it doesn\u2019t seem to get any attention until the affected person is deathly thin. Eating disorders have a lot of bad health consequences, and short of dying of starvation, you don\u2019t have to be shockingly underweight to suffer those consequences. When I was younger I was also diagnosed with bipolar II, though recently that diagnosis has changed to generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and depression. My own emotional immaturity, not understanding my own emotions, and the interplay of the two disorders probably contributed to the diagnosis of BPII and many years of heavy medication. So that\u2019s another thing people don\u2019t always know: these diagnosis typically aren\u2019t set in stone, particularly if you were diagnosed fairly young, as I was. As far as daily life, I cannot recall a time where I was not anxious. Even  my earliest memories are tinged with anxiety. I\u2019ve had suicidal thoughts on and off since I was an adolescent. As a result my view of \u201cnormal\u201d is skewed. My anxiety is probably around a 5-6 on a low anxiety day (like on vacation, or a lazy Saturday). It\u2019s not until I get to a 7+ that I start to notice it. I\u2019m scoring on a 1-10 scale where 1 is no anxiety, 10 is pure out-of-the-blue panic attack.  If I\u2019m below a 4, it feels weird. It feels like something is wrong. The easiest way to describe how my anxiety typically looks is to give an example. Most recently it was my covid vaccine. Initially planned on getting it as soon as I was eligible. Then I had people around me starting to pressure me to get it before I was eligible. When I feel that kind of pressure, I push back. I avoid. So then I decided I wasn\u2019t getting it. Then I started obsessing. The anxiety got so bad on a daily basis that I broke, and on first day of eligibility I signed up, with the caveat that if I couldn\u2019t get an appointment that week, and my fianc\u00e9 wasn\u2019t allowed to stay with me during the shot, I wasn\u2019t going to do it. My conditions were met, still about had a panic attack getting the shot (I hadn\u2019t had any shot for 20+ years).  But I got through it, and got my second one last week. None of my hesitancy was about the safety or efficacy of the shot. I don\u2019t think there are microchips or I\u2019m going to turn into a zombie.  It\u2019s about feeling like I am able to make my own decisions without outside pressure.So that\u2019s usually how it manifests. Have plan, feel backed into a corner I don\u2019t want to be in, resist, obsess, then break as long as I can still feel like the driver of my own life. If I can\u2019t, I double down.(If you know someone like me, the best advice I can give is back off. Let them know you\u2019re available to talk if they want, but don\u2019t try and force talk. If they do talk to you, try to be factual while a) acknowledging they are having anxiety and b) withholding judgement as much as you can.)","205":"Better public transit. I live near a city and I don't go out much because traveling means taking my car, and paying for parking (if it can be found) what's a walkable distance for most isn't for me, or I take longer to cover that distance which often means traveling alone.

The little 'trends' that go around are nothing more than just being a psychopathic sadist being horrible and cruel to people for no reason. I've heard stories of people hurting others just for a TikTok video, like kicking or punching them and then they get upset when the person jumps back.And look at this trending #Killallmen has done. It's already taken it's toll and a young boy has tried to commit suicide. These sexist misandristic vile TikTokers have got blood on their hands. It's actually cyberbullying.","298":"One thing that I absolutely love is how assault is a man's problem because \"most assaults are done by men\"... and in the meantime we absolutely DO NOT give a damn about manipulation, psychological abuse, etc, that are acts of violence that are a lot more available and common for women. And yet, it's absolutely ignored; to the point where gaslighting someone is usually seen as \"acting on one's own freedom\" and that's it. Let alone manipulating someone into something.It's easy to have one-sided violence when you cherry-pick what matters as violence, and encourage other bad behaviour in the name of freedom. A vast majority of gold-diggers are women; let's say women to teach each other not to do it.That's not how it works? How strange. I've seen way too many women constantly using others as they see fit and discarding them without any issue, while being encouraged for it because \"you go girl\" to the point where even someone asking for basic respect was seen as outrageous and going against one's personal choices. Some of these situations resulted in suicide attempts because it was done on people they already knew were weak psychologically. But this isn't considered \"violence\". Meanwhile, innocent men are supposed to be \"nice\" enough to take the blame and do all the legwork when it comes to women's safety (I thought it wasn't women's job to work to make things better for men? Don't things apply in the same way in reverse?). While abusing others psychologically is pretty much seen as a non-event, at least when it comes to women.That's one of the things that sicken me the most in this society: cherry-picking what counts as \"violence towards others\". A man is a criminal for doing something as terrible, trigger warning, as looking at someone, but someone constantly lying and gaslighting others, while throwing them away like handkerchiefs once they're not useful anymore, is fine and is just \"personal freedom\". Either you really care about morality or you don't. And if you do, maybe it's time to take into account what is bad and abusive behaviour but isn't considered as such nowadays. It's a bit too easy to constantly ignore how one's action can ruin someone's psyche or life just because there was no punch involved (despite the fact that for men, said punch will be a crime even if it was self-defense).Yeah, sure, it's easy to lay the blame of any societal violence on ONE target when you cherry-pick what counts as \"violence\". Meanwhile, if some men are scared of female manipulation and decide not to meet one-on-one, they're ALSO blamed for being scared despite women having a lot more power when it comes to ruining your life either socially or psychologically, given how society works.Punching\/killing someone is terrible. No question about it. But I always find it funny to see how other behaviours, that used to be, a fairly long time ago, seen as reprehensible, that can be just as dangerous and dehumanizing are all fine and dandy. And strangely enough, it's the kind of \"violence\" that is the most common for women. Funny how this works.According to this stupid comic, men absolutely are justified if they avoid contact with any and all women and refuse to associate with them, no matter how much it bothers them. Manipulation and psychologic abuse coming from women are a serious concern as well; and a concern that isn't even recognized by our society which makes it even more insidious; someone can mess with your head and make you suicidal, make you think that you're unworthy of the air you're breathing and that you shouldn't kill yourself, not because of yourself but because your blood would taint the poor wall behind you (a kind of message that I've heard multiple times from many friends), and it's all fine and dandy, it falls under the \"freedom\" category for these people. And that's not going into other problems, like manipulating men via lying into committing violence onto someone else. At worst, this person will be seen as a jerk. But it's not seen as \"equal\" as direct violence. Thus creating a disparity.Again, it's easy to twist violence numbers when you cherry-pick your \"violence\". An hypothetical country without any gun existing in it wouldn't have any gun-related death neither. It wouldn't say anything about any other case of death that isn't any better morally. And since these people are always trying to argue from a \"moral high ground\"... The hypocrisy.Okay, then from now on all men should \"cancel\" women because the the risk of manipulation, gaslighting or abuse that is involved (and at least physical violence is punished; this almost never is in comparison, particularly when the perpetrator is a woman), and this isn't \"misogyny\", it's keeping any risk factor at bay. I reaaally wonder how this'll work out.","299":"People like this should be banned from social media.

Been able to see some stuff on YouTube like raw interviews from The Red Pill and such. But when it comes to trying to find something that would be a deeper dive, it gets tough. Tried seeing if I could watch The Red Pill somewhere, but it's behind paywalls. Looked at my library to see what it's got. But my local library has zilch basically. The closest candidate I found for a \"men's rights\" book titled \"Why I'm not a feminist: A feminist manifesto\" but that's not really geared towards men's rights. But there were a nice number of options for feminist material. I might try looking at partner libraries more, but then there's also the question of how to actually access it. Like apparently one of the lending libraries does have web access for The Red Pill but the page I found it via doesn't actually give access. (Go figure.) And it's not like the library in my town is bad. It's actually very nice and well-funded. And there's been other times I get pleasantly surprised at what's available.

If anything, it would have been nice to included some stats and info about some mens issues. But overall, this is fine and I don't know what you're upset about.Edit: also men's issues generally aren't down to sexism, or rather the same kind of sexism that women face, which seems to be the focus of this infographic.This is also very basic info.

I'm still trying to learn.My 14 year old daughter and I were at a punk rock show last week. We go to them at least once a month, been great for bonding between us. While waiting for the first band to come on I noticed a younger woman probably early twenties was standing by herself looking a bit nervous. She was small and there are a lot of big guys around. I was a little worried she wouldn't be able to see the show or accidentally get stuck in a pit. I wanted to offer her to come up in front of the stage with my daughter and I. My daughter likes to be at the front and I stand behind her to protect her from anyone getting too rowdy. I'm a big dude, 6'3 240lbs so Im effectively a wall. Im a happily married man and have zero desire in this woman romantically.

You might change your mind!I want to preface this conversation with:1. I strongly believe that women suffer experiences through a variety of sources that may result in PTSD and other severe emotional trauma that may may them afraid of men. This is a thing that happens. This is not in question. People fail to recognize the severity of these traumas and say unhelpful stupid shit.2. Women have autonomy over their own bodies. If they choose to get a hysterectomy. It should be their choice. Women do have their choices for hysterectomies questioned and that's wrong. **BUT**The argument that the meme present is so full of holes that it frustrates and upsets me that it could undermine the feminist values that it is trying to defend. Maybe I need to let it slide... but if someone coming to this meme with any sense of caution might find that the argument fails to convince them and more over it may make them resistant to better arguments on the same subject in the future.Now, no argument is perfect, but there's some that are just cringeworthy.... like the one above IMHO.","325":"Equality Of oppurtunity but not equality of outcome.","326":"How should someone be punished for committing such a terrible act?

I personally just flat out think it's unreasonable. I think the breadwinner of whatever relationship should pay a reasonable amount of money to their ex partner, giving the person enough time to get on their feet, financially. They should be legally compelled to find work that pays a living wage or else the payments will continuously get smaller and smaller. After the person gets back on their feet, the breadwinner is freed from these obligations.This last point may sound silly, but the amount of divorced women who re-marry and yet still receive alimony from their previous husbands is asinine.","357":"I think it depends how old the customer is to be honest.

If attacked, you have the right for self-defense, and for that, you can use force appropriate to the danger. You also have the right to call the police\/report it to the policy afterward, because it is a crime to physically attack someone. This is true regardless of gender. The problem might arise from how to interpret 'force appropriate to the danger'. It is generally assumed that women are weaker thus they can't represent a real danger to men, thus men using physical force is never appropriate to the danger a woman can pose to them, but that is a very harmful thinking based on gender stereotypes. Women can and in some cases do pose a threat to men, and if you are in that situation you have the right to defend yourself as good as you can, and if it's necessary, you can use force for that. That is the same if you are attacked by another man. You can't just retaliate and go and kill him. You can defend yourself, and cause physical harm appropriate to the threat.","362":"The only Ion I know is the 20 ton fuck off death machine with a \u2018no you bitch\u2019 shield.","363":"\"penis owner\"see you never again","364":"She sounds like a literal genderbender niceguy, maybe we can create a sub to post about girls that act in this sort of way, we just need a good name like... nic... r\/kindgals.","365":"My husband and I have been together for 12 years. When we wanted to move to the outskirts of town and finally buy our first house, he was working 70 hour weeks. He stood back and trusted my judgement while I did all of the research and picked out our future home. He showed up on signing day and signed all of the papers and bought our home sight unseen because he trusted me and wanted me to be happy. At the time I was still fixing my credit from my parents using my identity to open utilities and he easily made 4x my salary. I felt so loved and was so excited about our future. I was telling girls at work about it and a single mom that loved to complain about her long string of extremely toxic relationships told me that she could never settle for a 'chump like that.'Excuse me? What? I just asked her how that was working out for her and walked away before she actually answered. Also, that was 5 years ago and this house is.

Just because you do something voluntarily, doesn't mean everyone does. So in the example (this is not mine) of a party, maybe there's a cake. Now, some people are going to be excited to eat the cake, and enjoy it. Others will be reluctant but feel the pressure to eat it, so they aren't rude. Some may hate cake, so refuse to eat it, but the organizer of the party forces them to in various ways.The people who love or are indifferent about cake will think eating it is a choice, when it is actually never was. Of course, with makeup, there is an element of choice to it, but that choice can be really hard to see or actualize for some.

Given the system we currently live in, if the most grave punishment was always called for, most universities would be unwilling to convict anything other than the most grave offense so most offenders would get away scott free. By using a gradient system, it is more likely that the offences deemed \"less serious\" would at the very least be condemned. Not a perfect system, but I understand the need for it. 3) yeah wtf with this one. What if they continue to assault you because you couldn't convict the first time? We have to just keep putting up with it until we're certain we can convict?

Not exactly about witches, but it is tangentially about the patriarchy, and how it effects me as a 29 year old heterosexual man. Over the last few years I\u2019ve been coming to terms with the effects that toxic masculinity has on our society, including myself. It\u2019s come at an unexpected cost though. throughout my adult life most of the women I\u2019ve become romantically attracted started out as friends who over time exhibited qualities I would love in a partner. I\u2019ve never acted on them in the past mostly for fear of rejection and also because I didn\u2019t want my friends to think I only got close with them for the sole purpose of sleeping with them, which is definitely not the case; physical attractiveness is such a small part of what leads me to catch feelings. So I always let these attractions go and eventually the friendships fade in some of the cases. In all this I\u2019ve learned that I\u2019ve stopped trusting myself when I\u2019m attracted to someone because I\u2019m worried about the attraction being for the \u201cwrong reasons.\u201d as a result I\u2019ve never fully learned how to approach the subject of romantic attraction with people who I\u2019m attracted too and have been in an almost perpetual \u201cunrequited love\u201d mindset, weary of become a \u201cnice guy\u201d who thinks he\u2019s owed something from the women he\u2019s attracted to. There\u2019s someone I like now and I really want to learn that I can trust myself with my feelings for her and that it\u2019s not purely driven from a sexual attraction (although that\u2019s there too.) I reaaaaallllly don\u2019t wanna fuck this one up because she has every quality I\u2019ve been searching for in a partner. she\u2019s also very much awakened to her divine feminine and very perceptive, and I\u2019m sure she senses my attraction to her.  I guess I don\u2019t really have a question as much as I\u2019m just looking for reassurance that being attracted to a friend isn\u2019t inherently toxic and maybe ask for some direction on how to approach the subject of m romantic attraction with a woman who can see through everything.*edited to add clarity.","385":"I have the exact same pattern on a dress!

I thankfully grew out of that fine and now have what I think is a very healthy relationship with alcohol. My fianc\u00e9 has a history of alcoholism in his family as well so we both are cautious, but are fine to have a drink 1-2x a week and occasionally get drunk with friends (pre Covid).

We\u2019re planning a wedding and buying a house, and I was in a fender bender that was my fault, and our agent called to say our offer on the house had been rejected, and it was just a hard-core shitty Tuesday. I texted him towards the end of the day to say that I had locked myself in my office to have a bit of a cry and felt slightly better, but I apologized in advance for being cranky.

If I have a major event happen like fighting with a friend or even falling out with someone, I'll allow myself to sit in the feelings for a bit. I can have 48 hours to be sad, cry, listen to sad music, kinda be reclusive and introverted, complain to friends and family about it. Then it's time to start healing; I may journal about the topic, meditate, try some breathing techniques, go for a walk, etc. Just to get the feelings out. Healing can take weeks and I may have bad days. But staying in that weepy, I can't function or do anything mood isn't healthy and I have to remember that too. If it's anger, I'll give it up to 24 hours. I can rage, go to the gym or go work out, journal, vent to a friend or family member, etc. I try not to make any major decisions in that time like no major purchases, nothin posted about it on social media, no blocking or unfriending, etc. Allow myself time to cool down and reevaluate how I'm feeling first before I decide to lash out in a permanent way. I may still be upset or frustrated after the 24 hours but then it's time to start working on slowly easing out of those feelings. Sitting in rage for too long puts the body in a fight or flight response which isn't healthy.","409":"How time consuming it all is. You think if you own your own business, it would equate to you getting a lot of free time since you're your own boss! But if I don't work on my business every day, then customers don't get what they ordered on time and my 300+ 5 star reviews would suffer. So I wish I knew how time consuming it all is. Rewarding, but exhausting.","410":"I reconcile with the fact that there\u2019s no such thing as wasted potential. When I woke up and realized that my journey was my own I was liberated from the expectations and pressures that had made me struggle for my whole life (even before the mental illness). A great book I\u2019d recommend is the Artist Way by Julia Cameron. I also go to a therapist that has greatly helped me change how I perceive myself and life. You must humanize your journey. Life happens to the best and brightest, the hard times are just as much a part of that story as the others. Please don\u2019t fault yourself ever for taking it slow and doing what you can to survive. After all that\u2019s what humans are made to do, survive. You are not a robot that mindlessly works. And lastly, ask if your surroundings (friends, fam, work) are contributing to these feelings of hopelessness. My friends supported me and my craziest dreams even when they made absolutely no sense lol. They were a huge part of me unlearning a lot of my def destructive habits. I hope none of this sounds harsh.

Deff a double standard","412":"In a country where raping women is seen as allowable.... seems right..","413":"The biggest mistake I see people make over and over is to decide what they believe in advance and then search for evidence that supports that.  Rational thought is the exact opposite: with an open mind, you seek out evidence, and then you let that evidence lead you to a logical conclusion.  The whole notion of the gender pay gap would have been GONE years ago if people would just take the \"evidence leads me\" approach.  But it's not just feminists who use \"conclusion first\" thought.  I see people on both the right and the left, or really from any political persuasion, go with \"conclusion first.\"  It's very frustrating because it leads to millions of people who are 100 percent certain they're right when they're not.  It's the same reason the Catholic Church was ready to torture Galileo for refusing to support their totally wrong geocentric model of the universe.  Study after study, and article after article, shows that the earnings differences between men and women are due to different choices made and not by any gender bias, but the pay gap nonsense persists.  It's actually been illegal since 1963 (in the USA) to pay women less for the same work.  What I find most frustrating is that even questioning the pay gap is considered misogyny.  There is no idea on this Earth that is except from scrutiny.  Nothing should be exempt.  Whole wars have been fought over the belief that the God myth should be exempt. And I feel almost like it would start a war if I posted the link to one of the articles debunking the gender pay gap on my Facebook page.  There's nothing at all hateful about questioning an idea.  Even if the pay gap rebuttals were somehow wrong, those rebuttals are still not the same thing as hate.  It's frustrating.  It's rare to meet a person who goes evidence first.  But it's what everyone should do.","414":"Wow and she is allowed to have more kids I guess . Wow","415":"(drool) But if he was innocent, then why did he kill himself?

Just shows the women\u2019s opinion is completely irrelevant in these places. Awful to think what these women go through.","526":"maybe this is an unpopular opinion in feminism, but I really dislike the whole 'onlyfans' and sexualised nudity on social media... which women claim is 'empowering'. I get to some people might feel temporarily 'empowered' to choose when to show off their body but what they are ultimately doing is objectifying themselves for the visual pleasure of others. They are doing it for the likes, for the attention and for the praise and with only fans - for the money. Is something that is done entirely for the public praise of doing it ever truly 'empowering'? I don\u2019t buy that its done for the individual posting it - because why post to a public forum.. just BE naked or pose sexy, on your own if it is just for you. I think maybe we have gotten caught up in an idea that anything women do is inherently okay because 'feminism' and to raise a point against it is somehow anti-feminist. I think onlyfans and sexual provocation\/nudity on social media devalues the female form, the brain of the woman, the achievements of the woman. And not just the women in question it devalues either so I think it goes beyond 'personal choice' but it also perpetuates that mentality of objectification... that women should be attractive and sexy and alluring etc etc etc I think it just flies in the face of everything feminists have tried to achieve for the female sex. You don\u2019t see top CEOs or high achieving men like Elon Musk, Jordan Peterson, Joe Rogan slapping their balls on Instagram and say it makes them feel good about themselves (for this to make sense you also have to imagine a world run my women who constantly objectify men\u2019s balls - and use them to sell almost everything to the masses). Now, I\u2019m not a prude, I have my insecurities but I am pretty much always naked at home and I don\u2019t entirely mind if someone outside sees me, I\u2019m not trying to be seen but I\u2019m pretty comfortable being naked at home, I\u2019d skinny dip in a heart beat, ive had naked drunken baths with friends and I love nudist beaches so this opinion isn\u2019t coming from the perspective of someone who is necessarily just skin shy. I was, however, abused as a child. Possibly from before the age of 4, a time which I have no memory of. and I can\u2019t help but think that the oversexualisation of women is a key factor in men treating women in the disgusting ways that they sometimes do. It is because they do not see them as equal, in cognitive or social or physical ability and I think when we push our tits together in a forever21 tank top with an arched back and a bit of side bum showing with some cheap ass caption of ''feel like an empowered woman, hbu?' it makes a f\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* mockery of actual empowered women striving to make a big difference in this world and cutting through the corporate male dominated world where men\u2019s heads are swimming with this kind of lurid imagery every time we give a presentation, host an event or lead on a business deal.

I think the issue is there is no room for discussion on serious topics. I have always been a trans ally, always felt strongly about equal rights. Here in Ontario, we have self-ID. I was supportive of self-ID, although it was kind of pushed through as law without the public knowing. There is a case here, where a man self-IDd as a woman, and was put in a low security prison.  When he was released, he started identifying as a man again. Here is the issue- while in prison, there were reports of him harassing inmates for sex, hitting on them, Intimidating them - and he sexually assaulted inmates. One has come forward and laid charges against him.  This was a huge eye-opener for me. While I support transwomen, actual transwomen, some laws started with good intentions are being abused - by MEN. It gives transwomen a bad rep.  When I try to discuss this very serious issue, I am shut down being called a bigot and TERF. Blocked before anyone will listen.  There needs to be reform with this law to protect women from predatory men.I get so upset, that female victims are being silenced on this issue, and so called feminist disregard these victims in  place of virtu-signally.It upsets me, that our media is keeping this case quiet - there is a narrative and nothing can question it.As feminist, we should be able to discuss all issues women face, without being bullied into silence.  Transwomen should be listening imo, bc these men are going to destroy all the work for equality that older transpeople have fought hard for. Having the public finally understand the pain of dysphoria, just to have sick men use their rights for their own sick, twisted ways.  None of our msm will report this case. This happened at a prison near me, and have spoken with other women who were housed with this man, and heard their experiences. All I have asked was for a discussion to find a compromise that keeps both transwomen and cis women safe from predatory men, and that makes me a.bigot apparently.  Anyone who does discuss it, basically says \"well its rare, shit happens\". What was the point of the  meetoo movement if we are to jjst suck it up and accept women will get raped?  Here is a link.  FYI, the term rape is not used in canada. We use \"sexual assault\" to various degrees.

I\u2019m a 24 year old male pursuing a doctoral degree in healthcare, and during my education I\u2019ve taken feminist theory, philosophy of sex and love, psychology of interpersonal dynamics, and some other classes on administration. In addition, throughout my college experience I\u2019ve had met people that are in relationships that are harmful to them, people that are victims of abuse, and been in bad relationships myself. Some of these people I\u2019ve met are by best friends now, but it took years to build trust or enable them to change their mindset to one that is healthy enough to be independent. The perspective I\u2019ve gotten from that experience has shown me a few things that can help you navigate what you are talking about. The most helpful thing is to model positive relationships. When a person has an abuser (this could even mean an unhealthy relationship, including those that enable patriarchal behavior) in their life, they need a support system because they are victims. We need to show them kindness, allow them to talk about their problems, and let them know we love them exactly as they are. People do not respond well to being told what to do, even when we view the solution (such as breaking up) to be clear. When we tell a distressed person what to do or think, we model the same behavior that the abuser is using. \u201cIt\u2019s normal for men to see strippers and you are a prude for not letting me\u201d is along the same line as \u201cyou should break up with him because he is wrong and hurting you\u201d, even if I agree with the latter statement much more. By using terms like \u201cif he is breaking the boundaries of your relationship, what do you think is a way to clarify to him that you need different things\u201d and \u201cyou are not \u201cthat girl\u201d, I think you are wonderful and everything you\u2019re saying makes sense. I\u2019m going to be here for you no matter what you decide to do, and will help you through it\u201d are much more empowering statements that encourage communication and problem solving, while also demonstrating care and respect. I\u2019ve found you can never tell someone to break up with their partner, but you can demonstrate that there is better love out there, and make them feel supported enough to make the jump of ending a relationship (which is REALLY scary because no one likes to feel alone). Over time, the person feels enough support to be able to make that life change because they have you. It takes time, but by being there for people and loving them you are doing good. Eventually, people do ask about what I believe, why I have been there for them, and when those questions come out a real foundation of meaningful friendship can be made. Sometimes people continue to choose unhealthy men that can\u2019t communicate or understand that relationships mean caring for another\u2019s happiness, even if it means not going to strip clubs (these are the immature ones). Learning open and two way communication is really hard, especially when you\u2019re 18. But you\u2019re learning it, and it\u2019s a wonderful process that will create meaningful and  lasting relationships. Being there for people has been my way of finding meaning in my life, and I hope you can help your friends move on to better men that listen, care, and work toward mutual happiness and love.","542":"I mean...

This *is* a problem because it takes away the viewer as a participant in the interpretation of the viewed act and warps the sense of what sex should be to the idea of something that is being done to someone and thus does normalize sexual assault.That is not to say that any depiction of non-simulated sexual acts would be wrong, just that the current hardocre pornography that relies on this fact as its marketing focus is.","557":"I\u2019m so sorry.

Luckily it was a long distance relationship so I was protected a lot by that. It was still a huge struggle and I was dehumanized and shamed constantly. I kept telling myself, well she doesn't mean me! I'm a good one! That wasn't actually protecting me from the damage to my self-esteem it created. She would do things like attack me for sending her sexy pics, I think because she had some envy issues or something, I couldn't make sense of it. Eventually it fell apart because I idiotically tried to protect her from some bad influences in her life, and that included a psycho that made up a bunch of horrible things about me once I asserted myself to cut me off from their circle in general.

I've seen so many people on Reddit, in the media, and other social media platforms, go from: woman was kidnapped and murdered to all men are dangerous\/ teach men not to....... \/ yes all men\/ and now: the police are sexist. I just can't get my head around it and I feel so alone in my opinions I'm starting to lose the plot a bit. And when I see seemingly pleasant posts paying respect for her with that dig at men attached, all I feel is that whoever shared it is virtue signalling and totally insincere.Whenever I see people mention how many men kill women, about sexism in the police, I want to explain that more men are victims of violence from strangers, and that the criminal system is hugely skewered in favour of women, not against them. Not that sentencing is the same as policing but you get my point. I don't comment this stuff out of respect for the lady who was killed, but these narratives are being perpetuated so much, at least in the UK.Why is it okay for men to be vilified in such broad terms and it be the popular opinion?","612":"Well 70% of kids that get killed by their family are murdered by their mothers and single moms commit the majority of child abuse","613":"Logically, you can group the issues of both men and women into the following categories:\\- Fairness of the written law\\- Fairness of the applied law\\- Societal fairness\\- Fairness of the money spent by the government\\- Fairness of the media\/entertrainment industries portrayal of a certain sex\\- Fairness in educationThere are probably more categories, but the list is good enough for a post here.Now, I don't specifically advocate for equality, I advocate for fairness. Equality is just a special case of fairness, and I'm totally fine with implementing equality.However, the most fundamental equality is the equality in the written and applied law.But in (almost?) all western countries, women do have clear legal advantages both in the written and the applied law.Often, people argue that this is needed to compensate for other inequalities, and I think this is a cheap excuse.In my country, womens retirement age is lower than mens. The reason this is the case is, because in the past, women were usually younger then men when they married, so for both sexes to statistically retire at the same time, women just got gifted a few years more retirement.Military is another obvious example, where men are legally forced to partake in military service (or pay a compensation fine) and women get a free pass. Often people respons with \"then we should abolish the army, or make it voluntary\". Imho, that's cherrypicking. IF you support equality AND you are against mandatory military service, you should support military service for women if there is the abolishment of the mandatory military service is not going to happen. You can then still advocate for abolishment of the military service.And that's only a tiny bit of the inequality in the written law.The next thing is the application of the law.As far as I know, and correct me if I am wrong, men get harder sentences for the same crimes.For example female pedophiles regularly get a slap on the wrist, because \"the 13 year old boy should be glad that he had sex with a hot teacher\" or something along the lines.Funny enough, both men and women judge women more lightly according to studies I've read (but again, I could be wrong), so as long as there is a human factor, the disadvantage of men in the application of the law will never fully vanish.That's why, I would love to have a judicial system that basically determines the sentence for a certain crime statically and only let judges decise in previously unknown edge cases.I skip societal fairness, because that's way to complicated of a topic, I think you could write books about it. But also societal fairness is basically made by society, which means it's democratic, it changes if we change, and forced changes will never work, only ever backfire.So let's get to an easier topic, tax money spent on a certain sex.I don't want perfect 50\/50 split here, because men and women are biologically different, which must be reflected in the money spent for health care.But when men pay twice the amount of taxes in their lifetimes (that's a guess, I don't know the exact number, but it's afaik a big difference), but get half the amount of money, because they both work longer and die earlier, it's kind of unfair to a level nobody who seeks equality can support.There's many things like that, and one important example is that governments support academic feminism, which is not scientific but a lobbying group for feminist interests. There's nothing generally wrong with grassroot lobbying for your own interests, but it's criminally corrupt when you get tax dollars for it.And then there is the media\/entertainment industries portrayal of men and women.Let's for example look at the female ghost busters movie. The assistent is not only a man, but he's absolutely stupid. Is that how feminists perceived the female secretary in ghost busters? I don't think so, because she was smart and strong.Truth is, men get portrayed as stupid idiots that can't do anything right until women do it for them very often. This is NEVER EVER the case for women.But I also dislike the portrayal of women in the media. For policital reasons they are sometimes portrayed as so extremely great, that the plot makes no sense anymore, because everybody else becomes just useless and insignificant. They become totally characterless. You can't even enjoy movies anymore like this. This was the case in star wars. The consequence of this is not even in favour of women, because the viewers, both men and women, get annoyed and start to be sceptical of moview with female leads.Also there was never a reason for it. We had great female leads for decades and everbody liked it. Take Kill Bill, Alien, Mulan, Star Gate and many others as examples. They were not woke, they were just women with character who filled their role to make their movies\/series better.And that was only about the entertainment industry, the media isn't exactly neutral too.Ant the education is another hot topic.For decades we were trying to encourage women, because they were less educated for historical reasons that they didn't cause.And now, men are less educated. What are we doing as a reaction? Still encouraging women and downplaying the issues of men... how that makes any sense to anyone escapes me.And we know for decades how you could easily improve mens performance. Competition, Cooperation, Gamification and more physical movement in between.So why don't we do it? I don't know.

You had a misandrist parent. That's horrible.","678":"What is the argument here? That men are dropping out of society? What does \"dropping out of society\" mean? Who exactly are the men who are \"dropping out of society\"? It seems that according to the author dropping out of society means not paying taxes\/paying fewer taxes because they say that >if men start \"dropping out\" of society in large numbers, tax revenues will decline. We don't know what men the author talks about, and because of that, we can't decide if this claim is true or not. In the US, the employment rate is increasing since 2012, both for men and for women and slightly more for men (Source: OECD). So this data contradicts the claim that men are dropping out of society in the sense that they are dropping out of the labor market. It is surely true for some segment of men, and it would be useful to talk about them, but this argument is so generalizing that it doesn't support constructive discussion on the matter. And at this generalized level, this claim is not even true (it is not true in the EU either, I don't know about other countries). The author gives two reasons for men dropping out of the labor market. One is the loss in economic opportunities leading to the middle class, the other is the changes in the institution of marriage. For the first, they say, that>many of the roads that led to the middle class have been closed. Entire industries have been crated up and shipped overseas. They say that because entire industries relocated overseas, many of the economic opportunities to maintain a middle-class life disappeared, which caused a decline in male employment. It may be a case in certain areas, but not at others. To decide if it is true or not, we should have an exact context. Again, this claim is just too generalized to spur a fruitful discussion. The second reason is that > marriage has been gutted to the point that a spouse can be better described as \"a roommate you have to pay a fortune to have evicted.\" What? You don't have to marry if you don't want and what is the relationship between marriage and losing jobs? The argument seems to imply that men losing jobs because they have to pay in case of divorce. I can't comprehend this argument. Divorce laws may be bad, even biased against men, but how does it affect the employment status? Then the argument goes on to suggest areas to consider regarding this decline. The first is that > The overwhelming majority of government revenue is *collected from* men. This is just not true. In the US, 66.3% of men and 54.5% of women were working in 2018 - they all paid taxes. More men work, but it's not an overwhelming majority. In the EU, 54% of all working people were men and 46% were women. This doesn't seem like an \"overwhelming majority\". (Source: Eurostat)The second area to consider is that> The overwhelming majority of government benefits are *collected by* women. The overwhelming majority are collected by families and children. It is sad that mostly mothers have custody of children, so they get to get the money given to the children. It depends on the country and state of course, but please let me know benefits only available to women and is not related to children (I don't live in the US, so there might be). And the third is that> The overwhelming majority of consumer spending is *controlled by* women. What do you mean by \"controlled\"? How do you measure it? It is a claim that is impossible to prove or disprove because of its vagueness. After stating that men are dropping out of society (which is not true at US level) and presenting three \"facts\" from which one is definitely not true, one is most likely not true but I could not find statistics on it, and one cannot be answered because of how it is phrased. And from these flawed facts, the argument concludes that social problems will arise. > if men start \"dropping out\" of society in large numbers, tax revenues will decline, entitlements will be cut, and consumer spending will fall. Also, birth rates will fall further, and given that our retirement programs rely on a large number of the young supporting the old, you have a recipe for trouble. The logic here might actually be true. So in a case when men start dropping out of the labor market, tax revenues will most likely decline. Because of that, entitlements may be cut in the long run. If there will be more unemployed men and also fewer entitlements, consumer spending would also fall and may cause lower birthrates. It does not necessarily happen that way, but I won't go more into detail, because it doesn't matter, because the very first premise is not true at the US level (i.e. men are dropping out of the labor market). So it may happen, but at the US level it doesn't seem happening. If the author is talking about other areas, specific regions, groups, etc. this may be true, but then we have to have a specific context and talk about that, which is actually a good, necessary and useful thing to do.","679":"I guess this was all pretty worthless.

Early practitioners were largely defendant-oriented (Herman\u00a02005), church-based (Fromme\u00a02007; Pavlich\u00a02005) and driven by \u201c\u2026 religious or progressive concerns for the fate of criminal defendants \u2026 \u201d (Herman\u00a02005, p. 578) amid increasing crime rates and an increasingly punitive environment of harsher sentencing. Herman (2005, p. 579) argued that the absence of a strong victim voice has \u201c\u2026 reproduced many of the same deficiencies as the traditional justice system in respect to victims\u2019 rights\u201d. In the early days, victims were not central to restorative justice. The profound nature of this absence was highlighted by Zehr\u2019s comments at a New Zealand hui (M\u0101ori term for meeting) in 2002: \u201c[I] t took me a long time to realize how deeply embedded the offender orientation is in so many of us, and in our concept of justice\u2026 \u201d (J\u00fclich\u00a02003, p. 45). The same critique could be made of the theory that emerged to support the practice of restorative justice. As Ashworth (2002) noted, theory development has tended to be led by practice. Victims\u2019 voices were similarly absent...restorative justice has not addressed structural inequality, discrimination or oppression, neither has it resolved pre-existing power imbalances between victim and offender, in particular for those offenders and victims who have a prior relationship or are known to each other (Stubbs\u00a02002), as they most often are in sexual violence. Also, it would seem that some restorative processes might have further re-victimized victims by misusing power and coercion or they have used victim-offender encounters for the benefit of offenders (Braithwaite\u00a02002; Strang\u00a02002). There is some concern, for example, that a reduction in the severity of penalties following participation in a restorative process may encourage offenders to assume responsibility solely to access lighter sentences...\"","733":"It's Lego.

The decision was made against the recommendation of the Robert Koch Institute, which is a government agency that researches disease control and prevention.The reasoning of our Minister-President, Markus S\u00f6der, is that the FFP2 masks will prevent an infection for the carrier of the mask as well as for their environment. That is true, if the mask is worn correctly.However, when I, a woman, wear a standard FFP2 mask, it is too big for my face. The mask is gaping at the chin and nose, even when using one of those masks with a metallic strip in it. Today, I noticed that I am not the only woman with this problem. The masks are gaping for all women I saw, while they do not gape for men. With my FFP2 mask, I am practically raw dogging train air. With the community mask I sewed myself, I never had this problem.My assumption is that the size of the masks are standardized to fit onto men's faces, as so many things are in our world. I am now stuck with buying special FFP2 masks made for my face, which will cost me more money. Friendly reminder here that women are, on average, much poorer than men due to a lot of women's work being unpaid and\/or underpaid.I can practically see already how in two weeks, headlines will read \"Women in Bavaria are having way higher Covid numbers than men! Why are women being so careless and irresponsible?!\".In case you want to read more about it: https:\/\/themunicheye.com\/ffp2-masks-now-compulsory-on-public-transport-3913EDIT: I am not against wearing a mask. I want the proper fitting masks available for women at the same price as the men's masks, and I want my government to listen to the scientists.","791":"Abstract:Nietzsche's famous phrase \"You go to women? Do not forget the whip!\" is often used as an example to demonstrate Nietzsche's misogyny.

The guy's assistant (female) sat down with me and his wife sat down with me, but he would not.

On the surface, it may seem reasonable as they are, for all appearances, supporting that group.However, something leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth. A white person doesn't know a black person's experience. They don't know the anger and frustration that comes from a lifetime of discrimination and bigotry. Nor does a man know the experience of a woman. Or a straight person that of a gay person's experience.There lacks a sincerity of experience, the justification for the outrage seems hollow. I can't quite put my finger on it. It just seems wrong. Am I out to lunch?

What is causing men o drop out of society?&#x200B;I just went on a subreddit called purple pill to see what other say, this is what one user said is the reason: \"Men are \"dropping out\" of society for two reasons. First, many of the roads that led to the middle class have been closed. Entire industries have been crated up and shipped overseas. Second, marriage has been gutted to the point that a spouse can be better described as \"a roommate you have to pay a fortune to have evicted.\"As far as the decline goes, reflect on the following:* The overwhelming majority of government revenue is *collected from* men.* The overwhelming majority of government benefits are *collected by* women.* The overwhelming majority of consumer spending is *controlled by* women.In short, if men start \"dropping out\" of society in large numbers, tax revenues will decline, entitlements will be cut, and consumer spending will fall. Also, birth rates will fall further, and given that our retirement programs rely on a large number of the young supporting the old, you have a recipe for trouble.\"&#x200B;Obviously this is one side of the debate, so im interested to hear the other side.","808":"You can check on wikip\u00e9dia.

Everyone has a bad apple or apples in their group, nobody could control what some else does or thinks. Everyone is different and generalizing a group that makes up half of the planet isn\u2019t gonna help nor is it progressive, just going to stirrup conflict, we don\u2019t need other conflicts in this world. It isn\u2019t my and other men\u2019s fault that some men treat women like objects, nor isn\u2019t women\u2019s fault that some women use men like objects.

For whatever reason lots of stereotypical boys think bad words are funny. Social situations require us to be social sometimes when we don\u2019t feel like it. You made the decision not to laugh at them. You seem to feel superior to them. Maybe you are. Maybe you aren\u2019t. Sometimes it\u2019s fun to be silly. I think you could try to be a little silly. It won\u2019t hurt anyone. You seem to not feel like you\u2019re a part of their group. I\u2019m guessing there are other groups you don\u2019t feel apart of. It\u2019s more fun to be included. They gave you an opportunity to include yourself. You opted out. Kids are dicks sometimes. Sometimes they\u2019re not. When they made the masturbation comment you could have disarmed that too. It sounds like you\u2019re wallowing in your otherness and victimhood. That\u2019s a horrible mindset. Do what you can to get out of it?  Make a stooid joke. Have stoopid fun. Don\u2019t be so serious. This was not an example of toxic masculinity. Be really really careful with that term. People who use it are trying to label any behaviour they don\u2019t like as toxic. It\u2019s a slippery slope. Their intent is the f\u00e9minisation of boys and young men. Dick jokes are funny. Your dad and your mom jokes are funny. Don\u2019t be so serious. Be a boy.

French Feminist Simone de Beauvoir whose major work \"The Second Sex\" set the stage for contemporary discussions of gender theory.    Another prominent French Feminist is Luce Irigaray who works on language within the framework of analysis of phallocentrism as well as analysis through a Marxist framework of Feminist topics and critiques of a range of philosophers and their thought through a critical Feminist lens.   Julia Kristeva and H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Cixous are also prominent French Feminist thinkers whose work falls within postructuralism (and also structuralism in Krisreva's case). Kristeva deals with literary theory and critique as well as semiotics (within linguistics the study of signs, signifiers, and the signified) among others. Cixous is associated with Derrida (they published a book together) and her work deals with language and communication and how they interrelate with sexuality among other topics.

There are several posts regarding anti-Asian racism on Everyday Feminism.","890":"What if, for example, the pay gap is not erased through achieving egalitarian legislation and social reforms (gender neutral children's toys, etc.)? What if the choices males and females choose, free from any gender influencing, etc. leads to more males still in higher risk jobs, working longer hours, and\/or being in higher paid jobs than females? Do you believe the only measure of true \"equity and equality\" is the outcome or the attempt to reach true parity? BTW, this is in no means a question meant to say we shouldn't be attempting to reach true equity\/equality between the genders, I am honestly curious to what defines \"success\" and to what lengths one believes society should go to achieve them (ie strip away free employment choice? Gender quotas for every job? Reduce pay\/promotions for males to erase the pay\/management gap? etc.)","891":"I was talking to a girl whose cleavage was a bit exposed (and I am NOT criticizing her or her right to dress like this) and as we were speaking, my eyes sort of drifted down to the area between her neck and her breasts, for maybe a bit longer then they should have.As we were taking, she covered her shirt up a little, then my eyes immediately moved back up to her eyes and stayed there. She didn\u2019t explicitly say anything (of course, this could\u2019ve been because it wouldn\u2019t have been worth her trouble), we continued to talk afterwards, and she didn\u2019t appear hostile, but I couldn\u2019t help but feel that I might\u2019ve made her uncomfortable. I genuinely feel terrible and contrite about what I did.I initially considered what I did to be a disrespectful and embarrassing faux pas, and something from which I should learn to refrain from such behavior in the future. Yet for whatever reason I began to dwell uncontrollably on what I did, and with each instance of contemplation my perception of my action worsened.I should preface by explaining that in the past I've had tics that compel me to do things I otherwise shouldn't do. One such example consists of looking at my feet a total of four glances while I'm driving, precisely because I know I'm not supposed to. Similarly, when swimming underwater, I feel compelled often to open my mouth and let water in four times, as I know that it would be best not to do so. These tics may seem trivial, but they have been natural for me for a long time.Such tics have been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. I say this not to convey that these tics have made my life unbearable\u2014they have not; rather, my purpose is to explain that these tics have become normalized for me. I\u2019ve always suspected there may be an attention deficit component to these tics.When I was young, I developed a similar tic-like habit whereby I would look at private parts. This eventually developed into something where I knew I wasn\u2019t supposed to do something, but precisely because of this I felt compelled to do it anyway. I don't know why this tic in general developed. Was it due to the frequent thoughts about sex I had when I was 6\/7? Was it due to innocuous portrayals of such behavior in movies\/TV? I\u2019d feel the need to steal glances at a private area a total of four times, in general. This urge has been there not just with women\u2019s d\u00e9colletage, but also with mens\u2019 crotches at times, or women\u2019s legs. This is especially true when I\u2019m engaged in conversation with someone. This urge-driven tic wouldn\u2019t necessarily always be there in every single interaction, but through some interactions it would be there.It\u2019s not that I deliberately try to leer or to make people uncomfortable. I don't openly stare, for instance, at a woman's chest for 10 seconds with wide eyes while drooling. I've never made comments, or touched, or tried to take up someone's personal space. I\u2019m not trying to prey on people, or to try to impose myself on them sexually. For whatever reason, it's like when talking to a woman for extended time, it's hard for me to keep still in general. My eyes wander haphazardly, and combined with this tic, this happens.And yet my reasons should not matter as much as the effects of what I did to her. She covered her shirt, and odds are good I made her feel uncomfortable. In the moment, I ascribed what happened here to my tic, and judged that I had been rude and disrespectful at worst, and that if I learned from this, I could move on. But over time, my dwelling in this became far worse. She'd continued talking to me during that conversation, and she wasn't hostile, true. But what was she not showing me? How can I be sure exactly how bad I made her feel? Maybe I ruined her day. Maybe I ruined her whole week. Maybe I made her feel less of herself. Maybe I've affected her life immutably. Are these exaggerations? Am I obsessing over this to an unreasonable degree, or are these possible, reasonable ramifications of what I did?Furthermore, I began to fear that maybe, whilst I'd believed that I was never openly leering\/ogling at people, what if I'd been wrong ever since I'd developed this tic? How many countless women could I have potentially made uncomfortable? No one has ever prior indicated that my presence made them uncomfortable. I've never been reported for anything even remotely minor. And yet I feel I can't be sure. I remember now just one other instance, from when I was younger, when a girl at school covered her shirt while I was talking to her. This is the only other time covering shirt had occurred. Was this due to my tic too?As I read stories of people like Morgan Freeman, Bill O'Rielly and their workplace sexual transgressions, I see small, maybe if only tangential, similarities between what they did and what I did. Men like this have commented in women's figures in the workplace, touched their skirts, asked them how they 'feel about sexual harassment.' These transgressions seem to me patently wrong and inexcusable. And yet another thing they've been accused of is leering women up and down. Coupled with their other systematic patterns of behavior, it seems as though this leering should be construed as further attempts to make women uncomfortable in the workplace. And although I've never been party to these other types of behavior, I can't help but feel peripherally associate with these men.Ultimately, I cannot ascertain for certain to what extent my actions in this instance stemmed from normalized tics, and to what extent it arose from subconscious irreverence for her person. I have little doubt that what I did stamp largely from a dependence on my normalized tics. Yet if I submitted to this tic, is this not the same as being irreverent to her person? Maybe I am no better than a Morgan Freeman\/Bill O'Rielly.I've been hoping that the fact that she may not have even noticed, or likely forgot about what happened soon thereafter, may mean that I should get to move on if I promise to do better. But why not take this logic to completion? If a man rapes a woman, and she was too drunk or incapacitated to remember it, does this make him any less of a rapist? By the same logic, would her forgetting this make me any less of a harasser? Of a predator? I understand that to conflate rape with looking at cleavage would be disingenuous at best and malicious at worst\u2014that's not my purpose. My purpose is to test this line of logic.I cannot live with myself thinking of myself as a sexual harasser. This label has been weighing on me for months at this point. I can't eat properly, and can't get assignments done, I'm hardly sleeping. Sound funny, or facetious? I'm being genuine. I am deeply sorry for what I did, and I understand now not only that what I did was wrong, but also why it was wrong. I am cognizant now of how differently women can perceive objectification, and that, even if my tics become difficult to resist, this is no excuse at all for disrespecting someone else's person. But I can't go on thinking of myself as a sexual harasser. I just can't.There are only two ways in which I could deviate from this course of action, either by rationalizing my actions or by and living with myself that way, or by accepting what I did, which would\u2014even if only slightly peripherally\u2014place me in a category of individuals with whom I am unequivocally unwilling to be associated. To commit to the former path would be to lead my life with unconscionable dishonesty; the latter, to undergo such a radical change in self-perception for which I have not the strength.There is no impartial mediator to help me guide my thoughts. I had one feminist friend who told me that I'm overreacting. Yet I'm confident that there would be other people who would say I'm not overreacting. But if one person thinks I'm a sexual harasser, there must be legitimacy to that, yes? If I'm even .5% associated with a group of people including Freeman, O'Rielly, Ansari, etc. I can't live right myself.I have virtually no concern with being potentially reported for sexual harassment. This isn't about that. It's about how I see myself. Judge me as you wish.","892":"(First time real poster and on mobile so im sorry in advance about typos and errors) I am a confused person who ive been affected by feminism negatively and i want to right my wrongs because i lost friends, love interests, and even a girl friend i held dear to me plus I dont know how to approach any girl properly and i dont know what to do how to fix things between us and more and they hated me because i didnt know about things like non-binary, genders, and more i just need helpContext: i am a straight white christian male who is a preachers boy and i had a lot of friends growing up and a lot of them where friends since kindergarten we would always have a difference of opinion be that what we liked because we had a lot of mock debates that were all in good fun in fact we had some of the greatest scores in are debate class my friends helped me though a lot of dark times in my life and brightened my day a ton of times and i got a girlfriend at 15 and she broke up with me a few months ago and everything fell apart because one day as we all hang out they were talking about something regarding how one of there parents didnt believe in non-binary people i got confused and i didnt know what that was when i asked questions about they got mad at me and things descended from thereWeeks later my friend went off on me and called me a bigot and a bunch of other things and some type of phobic and severed all contact with me and that crushed me and a month ago my gf broke up with me for another girl because i was too \u201csubmissive\u201d we never had sex and in fact i made a vow to lose my virginity on my honey moon i didnt understand a lot of things and i was left broken and confused and i have a hard time talking with new people because if my aspergers and general shyness and i dont understand a lot of things i love my friends and i really love my gf but i dont know where i went wrongNow i tried looking up my questions but it only raised more questions and anytime i try it leads me to confusing explanations and or groups that flat out just go radical on hate and men and sterilization of them so here i am depressed lonely and i just want to laugh with my friends again and if not that i want to learn how to love again i hate being alone and i want to find friends or love but i dont know how to any more im scared to overstep and lose them, be used again, cling to tightly and lose them im just sad and i dont know what to doI talked to my therapist about all this and well i try to move on but it feels like i cant and maybe people hear can help i wondered so thats why i asking hear i hope you dont judge me or hate me or hurt me i  just want to learn or at the very least get better as i have no idea how to talk to girls anymore and i though maybe people here might helpThank you-Z(Btw this is a throw away account and feel free to pm me advise or anything i just want help)Too long didnt read-i want help and advise on modern day feminism to help me understand and maybe fix thingsAnd i want to thank you all in advance if you do decide to help me thank you sooo much","893":"So Lesbians are beaten by other lesbians and nobody care because a man IS not involved","894":"I went to a queer pride match which was heavily organised by queer intersectional feminists and it was decided that people of colour and trans women would have a place at the front of the parade to highlight voices that are usually marginalised in queer politics.

We are a little too codependent, given we had a very little amount of time to figure out what true independence looks like.

Many people either don't believe, don't care, or also hate men.Feminism has huge leverage, and one can readily find phrases such as \"kill all men\" or other legitimate hate speech aimed at destroying men. If ever this place became a dumping ground against women, their actions, and the legal\/social bias against men, I would still support it. We can collectively share, learn, expose those who actively try to harm, and hopefully grow stronger. To have that sort of bond requires real stories from people's lives, as I know of nobody who develops a bond over statistics.Should it be complaining without a goal? No. Complain, find help, draw strength, continue on and keep trying to fix what can be fixed.

There's a thin line between sharing your honest feelings and inadvertently making a person with clinical depression or thoughts of self harm feel even more like a burden -- not exactly what you want to do.There's just very little practical information or support for the day to day issues of caregiving, especially where mental health is concerned. What do you say or do when someone you love is having a panic attack? Expressing suicidal thoughts at 3am on a Wednesday? How do you help ensure a fellow adult takes extremely necessary medication consistently if they struggle with routines and patterns? How do you balance all of this with a demanding job and being the primary manager of all household labour? What does it do to your own mental health, and how can you balance the functional responsibilities of caregiving with the responsibilities of your own health, mental or physical? Who knows? Maybe you can figure it all out with the three 30min \"well-being\" hotline sessions your employer allocates each year? The stigma around mental health is a huge issue, primarily for helping people manage their own and to seek help when they need it. But the secondary impact is that caregivers *also* feel ashamed and secretive, because 1) it may not feel like their own issue to 'share' with others, especially mutual friends and acquaintances, and 2) it's impossible not to feel like people will doubt you or simply conclude that you made poor relationship decisions somehow. While I don't want to minimise the caregiving challenges of someone looking after a loved one with cancer or another serious physical health issue, at least you can be sure that only the worst of humanity will treat it like a non-problem if you tell them what's happening.","947":"I have a couple given to me as gifts but I don\u2019t wear it.

Pointlessly gendered as the sub would say.There's the trope you identify, about undermining a woman that speaks out, because a woman speaking out is of itself unacceptable.Then there's the identification of the unreasonableness of the complaint in a gendered name. But both men and women are unreasonable, make silly complaints, are thoughtless. But only when a woman does it is that person called a Karen. (Altho actually, i think i have once seen a man referred to as being a Karen. But in some ways that was even worse, since it demanded that certain traits be seen as necessarily female...)The mistake lies in that, almost always in my experience, the criticism against the Karen is valid. But that doesn't mean we have to be sexist in calling it out. I don't use the term. Disclosure time. I identify as a man. Please excuse\/forgive if this therefore constitutes mansplaining.","952":"Securing the bag \ud83d\udcb0 I respect the grind","953":"Thank you.","954":"I\u2019m not sure a corpse\u2019s rights to bodily autonomy should be valued the same as a living persons.","955":"I don't really care either way.

Sexualizing yourself is your right, but it's certainly not feminist and you're still contributing to the objectification and sexualization of women as a whole. I understand that you could consider making a fortune off of straight male sexuality some sort of empowering, but you're also pandering to the patriarchy in the process. As you said, it's none of my business what people choose to do with their body, but as a feminist, I'm going to criticize this trend and what it means for women without attacking the individual woman. I especially think this is damaging to young girls and teenagers who are now being thought that empowerment comes from showing off as much of their body as possible and all that matters is how popular you are on social media. I don't have a TikTok, but I've read some horror stories of pedophilia on there with adult men convincing pre-pubescent girls to twerk for them and these girls thinking it's fine because they see the likes of Cardi B do the same thing on TV.","957":"Yea women should be above the law \ud83d\ude44 sounds like someone got caught by their parents having sex and claiming he raped her, true story actually happened at my high school, court pulled up the text messages classes ming she wanted it and even intimated it before crying rape, some people are just disgusting","958":"Hello, thank you for your post.

Though it's an interesting point you make about Latin America, lots of that news seems to have been really poorly spread, I hadn't heard of this at all and nobody I speak to had either. Meanwhile we all know about the toxic extremes of so-called feminism that's always going on. This is part of the problem, it used to be that people's reactions would pass this kind of news along, but now it seems media outlets are leading with these stories for more profit and interest while the actual important stuff goes a little more unnoticed.You'll find that people and platforms who identify as Egalitarian rather than Feminist are much better and give more shits about real issues. Someone who only believes they should stand for the rights of their own demographic and not everyone is gonna be problematic sooner or later.","1005":"Because feminism only cares about the hard power of the smallest number of men. It loves to turn a blind eye on soft power.

Everyone in this world has it tough and assuming depressed women are just over reacting because they are women is pretty condescending.","1012":"Imagine being apart of a group of people whose sole purpose is to deny another group of people their basic human rights and thinking that you're a righteous person.There's a level of evil here that simply astonishes me.But when you teach people that their acceptable targets in society and that some bigotry is justified, you can't be shocked when people behave like monsters.It's just madness.","1013":"No sexual bias in the legal system that I can see.

Men should be held at the same standards, ie, we shouldn't be allowed to wear pants that show our penis.","1015":"Funny how feminists will claim this as facts without actually knowing what misandry and what consequences it has.

The problem is that word 'partially.'Women are at a disadvantage when it comes to physical aggression.  It doesn\u2019t mean they can't or won't do it, but simply due to the fact that men are larger and have more upper body muscle mass, it makes such cases different. For instance, there is an increasing body of work that show women are at least as likely to physically abuse men, but men are far more likely to inflict severe physical injury when abusing women.Women also tend to be specialists at forms of abuse that, while there are men that do such, as a whole you will find men are simply not as 'gifted' there. I am specifically referring to verbal and mental abuse. In essence the sexes, while both engaging in the area the other specializes in, tend to move to specific types of abuse based on general predilections that are true generally if not for every case.Minimizing the damaging effects of either type of abuse is both dangerous and irresponsible.","1017":"Statistically obvious issues \\+ societal ignorance about those issues(+ personal affectedness)","1018":"Hello, please message the moderation team with proof of your ethical approval.

We truly love to see it! In a sign that Biden is doing something right, one of the executive orders he issued on Wednesday night has pissed off a cohort of some of the worst people in the world\u2014TERFs and other supposed feminists who have made it their mission in life in recent years to loudly fight the expansion of trans rights. Meant to tackle \u201cdiscrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation,\u201d Biden\u2019s executive order essentially calls on federal agencies to broadly apply last year\u2019s landmark Bostock ruling, which expanded the definition of sex discrimination to include discrimination based on sexual orientation as well as gender identity. Notably, the executive order included the line, \u201cChildren should be able to learn without worrying about whether they will be denied access to the restroom, the locker room, or school sports,\u201d and stated that Bostock should also apply to Title IX, the federal law that prohibits discrimination in federally funded schools.This has major implications for trans students, and signals an extremely welcome shift after the Trump administration, which marshaled the considerable resources of the federal government to make the lives of trans people as mean and limited as it possibly could. \u201cIt is such a relief to have a government that is committed to preventing discrimination as opposed to enabling it,\u201d wrote the ACLU\u2019s James Esseks, the director of the group\u2019s LGBT & HIV Project, in a statement in response to the executive order. As the National Women\u2019s Law Center\u2019s Gillian Branstetter told Jezebel via email, Biden\u2019s executive order \u201cis a critical recognition of both last summer\u2019s [Bostock] Supreme Court victory and the right of every person to learn, labor, and live without fear of prejudice or bias.\u201dBIDEN, THEY CROAKED, IS \u201cERASING WOMEN.\u201dBut the move hit differently for all those who have spent recent years cloaking their transphobia in a shallow concern for women and girls. Biden, they croaked, is \u201cerasing women.\u201dThe Women\u2019s Liberation Front, or WoLF, a small group of so-called \u201cradical feminists\u201d who have partnered with the religious right to campaign against trans rights, wrote that Biden\u2019s executive order \u201cis a disaster for women and girls in the U.S.\u201d and an \u201cunprecedented attack on women\u2019s rights and civil liberties.\u201d Abigail Shrier, the writer whose book title\u2014Irreversible Damage: The Transgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters\u2014tells you all you need to know about her, jumped in with her own hyperbolic take, which was retweeted widely. \u201cA new glass ceiling was just placed over girls,\u201d warned Shrier darkly, adding that the executive order \u201cunilaterally eviscerates women\u2019s sports.\u201d Even the Brits decided to weigh in; in a since-deleted tweet, the writer Hadley Freeman bemoaned that Biden\u2019s move was \u201cterrible,\u201d adding later that it \u201cwill kill women\u2019s sport.\u201dThat this fretting is actually anti-trans fearmongering hidden under the guise of a warped and outdated notion of feminism should be apparent. But the handwringing does, in its own way, acknowledge the potential repercussions that Biden\u2019s executive order represents. As many have noted, it may give the many Republican legislators who are pushing bills targeting trans high school athletes a bit of pause, given that Biden\u2019s executive order signals that the Department of Education may move to revoke federal funds from states that pass discriminatory laws against trans students. As the ACLU\u2019s Chase Strangio put it, commenting on Montana\u2019s bill being debated on Thursday that would bar trans girls from athletics, \u201cThe legislature is playing games with the state\u2019s education system to attack trans young people.\u201d He added, \u201cRight now lawmakers are not only voting on trans lives but threatening the state\u2019s federal funding.\u201d Financial consequences, after all, seem to be the only ones that bigoted state lawmakers ever care about.","1034":"What about solo porn where a woman just masterbates on camera ?","1035":"My aunt and uncle are both doctors who work at the same place doing the same thing and they get mail addressed to Dr. & Mrs. Last Name all the time.","1036":"My brother just got back from uni recently, I haven\u2019t seen him in 7 months because of covid (and I\u2019m pretty thankful for it.

My tone and pitch were constant and I was saying it lightheartedly and yet he still started acting like I was screaming at him for it. He made a motion to \u2018calm me down\u2019 with his hands and even exclaimed \u2018Jesus Christ\u2019 as if I\u2019d been yelling. He does this every time I express an opinion, even if it doesn\u2019t mean anything. During the same meal he did this when I answered that the reason there were so many flies was because we were eating outside.Even when we were younger he would tell me to butt out of discussions because \u2018it didn\u2019t involve me\u2019 even if it directly did. At that time I could never understand why, I\u2019ve realised now it\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t take me or my opinions seriously. Everything I say he acts like is unreasonable or an overreaction. I\u2019ve been constantly checking myself around him for our entire lives. I never even noticed until he left and I saw the difference. He may be my brother, but I have no respect for him because of the way he acts. I made this post because I wanted to ask if anybody had any similar experiences.

Meaning any woman who gives birth in the US will suffer severe economic consequences.We all know that feminism is need globally but we must not let people tell us that it isn\u2019t needed in the west because equality has already been reached.Remember the Equal Rights Amendment has never been ratified unto the constitution.

I totally understand tho, that some women do it to survive and that it is a way to get extra money and sometimes you can't think of the negative effects it has on society cause you just need the money, so thinking about it deeply and technically I'd say that you can do what you want with your body thanks to feminism, but using it for money is not contributing to actual feminism, tho no one should judge you for it","1063":"Good stuff.

That's delusional self deception.Listen, if you want to call yourself a feminist, I don't care. I've been investigating feminism for more than 9 years now, and people like you used to piss me off, because to my mind all you were doing was providing cover and ballast for the powerful political and academic feminists you claim are just jerks. And believe me, they ARE jerks. If you knew half of what I know about the things they've done under the banner of feminism, maybe you'd stop calling yourself one.But I want you to know. You don't matter. You're not the director of the Feminist Majority Foundation and editor of Ms. Magazine, Katherine Spillar, who said of domestic violence: \"Well, that's just a clean-up word for wife-beating,\" and went on to add that regarding male victims of dating violence, \"we know it's not girls beating up boys, it's boys beating up girls.\"You're not Jan Reimer, former mayor of Edmonton and long-time head of Alberta's Network of Women's Shelters, who just a few years ago refused to appear on a TV program discussing male victims of domestic violence, because for her to even show up and discuss it would lend legitimacy to the idea that they exist.You're not Mary P Koss, who describes male victims of female rapists in her academic papers as being not rape victims because they were \"ambivalent about their sexual desires\" (if you don't know what that means, it's that they actually wanted it), and then went on to define them out of the definition of rape in the CDC's research because it's inappropriate to consider what happened to them rape.You're not the National Organization for Women, and its associated legal foundations, who lobbied to replace the gender neutral federal Family Violence Prevention and Services Act of 1984 with the obscenely gendered Violence Against Women Act of 1994. The passing of that law cut male victims out of support services and legal assistance in more than 60 passages, just because they were male.You're not the Florida chapter of the NOW, who successfully lobbied to have Governor Rick Scott veto not one, but two alimony reform bills in the last ten years, bills that had passed both houses with overwhelming bipartisan support, and were supported by more than 70% of the electorate.You're not the feminist group in Maryland who convinced every female member of the House on both sides of the aisle to walk off the floor when a shared parenting bill came up for a vote, meaning the quorum could not be met and the bill died then and there.You're not the feminists in Canada agitating to remove sexual assault from the normal criminal courts, into quasi-criminal courts of equity where the burden of proof would be lowered, the defendant could be compelled to testify, discovery would go both ways, and defendants would not be entitled to a public defender.You're not Professor Elizabeth Sheehy, who wrote a book advocating that women not only have the right to murder their husbands without fear of prosecution if they make a claim of abuse, but that they have the moral responsibility to murder their husbands.You're not the feminist legal scholars and advocates who successfully changed rape laws such that a woman's history of making multiple false allegations of rape can be excluded from evidence at trial because it's \"part of her sexual history.\"You're not the feminists who splattered the media with the false claim that putting your penis in a passed-out woman's mouth is \"not a crime\" in Oklahoma, because the prosecutor was incompetent and charged the defendant under an inappropriate statute (forcible sodomy) and the higher court refused to expand the definition of that statute beyond its intended scope when there was already a perfectly good one (sexual battery) already there. You're not the idiot feminists lying to the public and potentially putting women in Oklahoma at risk by telling potential offenders there's a \"legal\" way to rape them.And you're none of the hundreds or thousands of feminist scholars, writers, thinkers, researchers, teachers and philosophers who constructed and propagate the body of bunkum theories upon which all of these atrocities are based.You're the true feminist.

It's called the \"black number\" it refers to all the crimes committed that were not reported to the police.Sexual assault is considered to be the crime with the highest black number because it's so taboo. Since metoo we saw a rise in the amount of registered sexual assault, not because men were commiting more but because it was less taboo (for women) to report. Now we have a different problem, since society sees sexual assault as a women only issue, men are not taken seriously when they report that they themselves were victims, some men get raped but don't report because they got brainwashed into thinking that men can't be raped. People use this to say \"see, they're so many more female victims of sexual assault, so the problem is men\". The reality is more complicated, it is reasonable to think that more women gets sexually assaulted but it could be a proportion of 80\/20 or even 60\/40, we won't know until more studies goes out. But obviously, studies about male victims of sexual assault don't get a lot of funding.Also, I'm talking here about official criminal statistics, a lot of feminists \"research\" use self-revealed surveys, that often blur the line between sexual harassment and sexual assault. They also tend to give those surveys to populations that are more exposed to those behaviors (young college women, for example) and they generalize to whole study saying that \"it's about ALL women\".Anyways, feminists and society at large would benefit from a class of criminology.","1114":"I read that too.

I'm aware of this certain article that debunks the claim by indicating that the gender differences within stem careers in Nordic countries are exaggerated by the rigid child support systems implemented by the government.

It's likely that they are just as annoyed but don't dare to speak up.Maybe this could set things moving, that together they tell her they don't like her misandry.Often, people just are too afraid to say something because they are unsure if they are the only one who sees the problem. This leads to asshole being unchallenged.","1222":"Society can't protect people from all harm: it's impossible. The best that can be achieved is risk reduction and this is accomplished by society and the individual: both have responsibilities over the outcome. For example, the local Council is usually responsible for ensuring paths do not have significant tripping hazards, but it is the individuals responsibility to ensure they do not contribute to the risk themselves with loose shoelaces or not looking where they are walking.The world is a dangerous place: you might believe you are entitled not to be harmed in any way, but that is a false expectation. So what do we do with the fear that everything out there is potentially going to harm us?The reality is that actual harm is naturally mediated by circumstance including motive, means and opportunity. If we look at statistics of harm, any individual generally has a very low risk of experiencing serious harm and although the risk increases for less serious harm, it is still usually quite low and also the impact of that harm is less.Based on the low probability of harm and the very low probability of serious harm, our fears should be much lower than believing everything out there is going to harm us and maybe low enough that living our lives, even in the presence of some harm, is a risk we are willing to take versus the certainty of harm in not living our lives if we isolate ourselves from the world outside. However, it requires rational moderation of our own emotional impulses for our fears to be put into perspective and proportion and unfortunately, for whatever reason, some elements in our community are stoking emotional impulses instead of rational moderation.Society and the individual can further reduce risk by ameliorating the circumstantial factors of motive, means and opportunity. Deliberately making ourselves helpless to defend ourselves by becoming intoxicated, for example, increases opportunity for harm.Deterrents can act as a motive modifier, but only in circumstances where rational moderation of emotional impulses is engaged: they are relatively ineffectual if an action potentially resulting in harm stems from a strong emotional impulse or impulse moderation is compromised. That's why crimes of passion tend to ignore punitive laws: angry people ignoring Apprehended Violence Orders for example. In terms of outcome, relying on deterrents to minimise all crimes is counterproductive as it generates a false sense of security: punishing harm is little comfort, after the fact, when the harm has already occurred. Far better to aim for prevention as much as that is possible. Unfortunately our system is setup almost entirely based on deterrence through punishment.","1223":"It really is gross how many people say KAM, it makes me feel ill.","1224":"Because unlike literally all the female\/feminist subs, this sub doesn't ban like it's going out of style.","1225":"What do you say to the people who argue that making this decision for a child that can't consent isn't an issue because it is morally equivalent to something like religious indoctrination (or upbringing for a more neutral term), or that this logic at least leads down the road of suddenly looking at parents making decisions for their children in general as child abuse.When my step dad's brother argued this, I felt kind of out of my element. He is a doctor himself and could also speak from a place of experience (although European, so uncommon but still legal). What's your opinion on this being like \"forcing\" a worldview upon your child? (My counter was that a worldview is not permanent, but I guess the childhood experience carries long term effects that can be seen as just as permanent as circumcision).","1226":"Imagine if they said something like this about a women.

Letting him in, chatting for 10 minutes, then telling him to go home (like I told him before he had entered the building).4. Letting him in, having sex, then telling him to go home (because I wanted the bed to myself).There have been more cases than that. But you know what? On *no* occasion has my telling him to go home resulted in the date never talking to me again. Quite the opposite.

You're not the director of the Feminist Majority Foundation and editor of Ms. Magazine, Katherine Spillar, who said of domestic violence: \"Well, that's just a clean-up word for wife-beating,\" and went on to add that regarding male victims of dating violence, \"we know it's not girls beating up boys, it's boys beating up girls.\"You're not Jan Reimer, former mayor of Edmonton and long-time head of Alberta's Network of Women's Shelters, who just a few years ago refused to appear on a TV program discussing male victims of domestic violence, because for her to even show up and discuss it would lend legitimacy to the idea that they exist.You're not Mary P Koss, who describes male victims of female rapists in her academic papers as being not rape victims because they were \"ambivalent about their sexual desires\" (if you don't know what that means, it's that they actually wanted it), and then went on to define them out of the definition of rape in the CDC's research because it's inappropriate to consider what happened to them rape.You're not the National Organization for Women, and its associated legal foundations, who lobbied to replace the gender neutral federal Family Violence Prevention and Services Act of 1984 with the obscenely gendered Violence Against Women Act of 1994. The passing of that law cut male victims out of support services and legal assistance in more than 60 passages, just because they were male.You're not the Florida chapter of the NOW, who successfully lobbied to have Governor Rick Scott veto not one, but two alimony reform bills in the last ten years, bills that had passed both houses with overwhelming bipartisan support, and were supported by more than 70% of the electorate.You're not the feminist group in Maryland who convinced every female member of the House on both sides of the aisle to walk off the floor when a shared parenting bill came up for a vote, meaning the quorum could not be met and the bill died then and there.You're not the feminists in Canada agitating to remove sexual assault from the normal criminal courts, into quasi-criminal courts of equity where the burden of proof would be lowered, the defendant could be compelled to testify, discovery would go both ways, and defendants would not be entitled to a public defender.You're not Professor Elizabeth Sheehy, who wrote a book advocating that women not only have the right to murder their husbands without fear of prosecution if they make a claim of abuse, but that they have the moral responsibility to murder their husbands.You're not the feminist legal scholars and advocates who successfully changed rape laws such that a woman's history of making multiple false allegations of rape can be excluded from evidence at trial because it's \"part of her sexual history.\"You're not the feminists who splattered the media with the false claim that putting your penis in a passed-out woman's mouth is \"not a crime\" in Oklahoma, because the prosecutor was incompetent and charged the defendant under an inappropriate statute (forcible sodomy) and the higher court refused to expand the definition of that statute beyond its intended scope when there was already a perfectly good one (sexual battery) already there. You're not the idiot feminists lying to the public and potentially putting women in Oklahoma at risk by telling potential offenders there's a \"legal\" way to rape them.And you're none of the hundreds or thousands of feminist scholars, writers, thinkers, researchers, teachers and philosophers who constructed and propagate the body of bunkum theories upon which all of these atrocities are based.No...You're the true feminist.

Especially as I have a family that would happily screw him over if something happened to me.Of course it's taken us 10 years of a very happy and loving relationship to get to this point where we feel confident in embracing those legal rights.

I am a man, and I have rarely been sexually harassed by men, despite being in the theater program, in which only one other man is straight. I have been sexually harassed and assaulted by a few different women, one of whom showed me porn, flashed me and about four other people her tit,  twerked on a guy that I know, tried to twerk on me, and grabbed my dick, all while having a boyfriend at the time.. None of this was with consent, and none of it was enjoyed, despite the stereotype that male victims aren't victims because they like it. Sexual aggression is not related to sexism, it's related to feelings of power, which women want just as much as men.&#x200B;To be clear, I am not anti-feminist. I just think that many feminists do not know the challenges that men face, and rape of men not being taken seriously is one of the worst things about being a man.  Male rape victims have been ridiculed, told to \"Man up\", and forced to pay child support while their rapist gets to keep the child. [Example 1](https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/news\/nation\/2014\/09\/02\/statutory-rape-victim-child-support\/14953965\/), [Example 2](https:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/us\/blog\/talking-about-trauma\/201902\/when-male-rape-victims-are-accountable-child-support)&#x200B;I **do not** intend to downplay any struggles that women face, and I have heard stories of male rapists getting custody of the victims child.

Surrogacy also might mean your having sex with a woman, so you'd have to be mindful of sex laws and false rape accusations. Outside of that, surrogacy may be fine. If your family is willing to help you raise the child, then childcare may not be an issue either.","1366":"This is perfect","1367":"It was the same with Sean Connery recently, I saw a lot of celebrities post condolences even the ones that call themself feminist. When you are rich and famous you aren't held to the same standart.","1368":"Totally true.","1369":" james deen is a fucking rapist piece of shit","1370":"Can\u2019t quite put into words how disgusted I am at this","1371":"I empathize. I just want you to know that.Some men are able to truly be allies to women and see women as fully human. But they are depressingly rare. Most men won't take women's perspectives seriously. It's like men's testimony is fine to them but women's holds no weight. It's so fucked up. I'm so sick of it too. I don't know what the solution is for you, but do what you need to do. If separatism is what will help you feel safer and stronger, then go for it. Do what you need to do to build yourself up.","1372":"The use of female makes me cringe and while a lot of people are simply unaware or ignorant of why it is an issue they've also often internalized and rationalized the type of misogyny that goes with the use.To make it simple if someone uses male or female in the same manner in the purpose it's intended as an adjective to specify gender as in : female police officer, male firefighter. It's the normal use of the term.If someone uses men\/females or man\/female it is inherently sexist. It's dehumanizing in the same manner that calling a Black person \"a Black\" is dehumanizing. They literally take the personhood away from individuals or groups they consider beneath men. Both men and women can be misogynistic and can consider women beneath men just like anyone can be racist, internalized misogyny is really common. So even if a woman uses it doesn't make it \"not sexist\". There's no free pass here.If someone uses male\/female or females\/males in the same place it's not necessarily problematic but really if someone can use the terms for human male and human female that are Woman\/Man correctly why not use them?Tldr: Male\/Female should be used as an adjective to indicate gender specifically.Woman\/man should be used as a noun for it's intended purpose human male = man, human female = woman.PS: it's particularly striking in some other languages where no one would dream of calling a woman by a term usually reserved for biology or other species of animal. One might as well straight up call a woman a Cow or Bitch as that is how it can be perceived.","1373":"I keep forgetting how the state mandates women to have a baby for one and that not doing so results in prison time. I also keep forgetting how sitting in a nice warm home and playing peekaboo with a newborn baby is as dangerous and traumatic as being shot at in some war torn hell hole and watching your friends get blown up; but, y'know it's men that send other men there so that totally means it's not sexist at all.","1374":"A lot of the comments are saying, \u201cWell we can\u2019t tell which men might rape us, so we have to be suspicious of all of them.\u201d By the same token, I can\u2019t tell which women might falsely accuse me of rape, so I have to be suspicious of all of them.","1375":"Whenever someone says to me western men are all bad and they support muslims (I don't mean all of them, the ones in the western world aren't as extreme and i'm sure there are good people in muslim countries in africa\/asia aswell). So what the corret term? Extremist muslims? You get what i mean. I just say \"i agree with you, western men are trash and i'm should start thinking about women and gay people like they do over there\". I don't mean it but it shuts them up immediately.","1376":"Because Men's Rights ***STARTED*** from the Red Pill.  The Red Pill was the first one who took a honest look at the world and mirrored back the reality untwisted by cultural mirrors.  In many ways, MRA is a specific segment of TRP that deals with less controversial, less unsavory conclusions.","1377":"    Ive been following this sub for what I think is a while. I believe we live In a gyno-centric society. I have seen all the posts about women getting off easier, or pushing the same thought that would have man burned. I think we need more posts about how to be better.        1. As a whole.  2. For ourselves. 3. World and shit.    I realize that better is not the best way to put it (one mans better is another mans pussy liberal yada yada).     I guess what I\u2019m wondering is if we can think of personal strategies that protect ourselves while empowering the masculine. While also seeing humans as a whole are imperfect incase of my buddy that wanted to fight me after ufc fight (fuck you greg my wifes sisters kids were there love you though.)","1378":"ImagineMyShock","1379":"This is disgusting.","1380":"how is it more civilized to cover up a heinous act with polite language. The care for words means more that the act of raping a child? Anyone printing 'softening' yet abstractly-accurate captions like this are culpable for helping to perpetuate such crimes.","1381":"I absolutely cannot understand how that's a thought which ran into this wretch's mind after his child was born. I myself would have never thought of it to begin with and I was too busy cherishing this new life in my arms anyway.&#x200B;As a guy (enby tbh) I'm absolutely disgusted.","1382":"It's a huge problem in Nigeria, the welfare groups and the police act independently, and that's if at all they take any action. The overwhelming majority do not attempt reporting out of fear of retribution from their attackers, being blamed and turned away, or severely mishandled by the police. If the welfare groups had more building fronts and activists, more women would be aware that they exist and turn to them for help. The police are dependant on the activists to basically settle cases. But there are just not enough volunteers or money. They were just discussing on NPR not too long ago. It's heart breaking and puts things in perspective. Thanks for sharing this article!","1383":"But \"the countless statues valourising the deeds of men\" presuppose and produce a certain legitimizing gaze toward them in their recurring attributes (including clothes) that really shouldn't model what is honorary.   I mean... doing realistic or naturalistic human sculptures in archetypical materials to honor people is reducing whatever meaning their memory may carry to vain objects, stagnant 'beauty' toys, anyway. It's necessarily conservative and lame.","1384":"I haven't found a lot of value in looking for the perfect cishet man ally. Instead I've had more success finding ones who are willing to lend their privilege and do work in a specific area, and then directing that work or connecting them with marginalized people who can direct their work. I don't assess my friends on a woke\/ally scale but I do gravitate towards people with shared values, without expecting them (or me) to be perfect - just open to growth.","1385":"The problem here though is that Joe Biden could take the high road but the sitting Orange in Chief has already taken the low(est) road.The [Summer Zervos lawsuit](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Donald_Trump_sexual_misconduct_allegations#Summer_Zervos_(2007) is still on-going and Trump were supposed to testify January 31.

There was also a civil lawsuit that alleged that Trump [raped a 13 year old](https:\/\/www.snopes.com\/news\/2016\/06\/23\/donald-trump-rape-lawsuit\/).I'm not defending Biden, as a non-US citizen I have no horse in this race, aside from Trump being what I consider a global threat. What I do hate is that we can't seem to break the status quo. The rich and powerful and dirty old men continue to rule the world.","1386":"Wow this is so true. Pisses me the fuck off","1387":"The best argument they have is \u201cwomen are payed less then men in the same job, at the same company\u201d. Guess what, if I work 1 hour a week at McDonald\u2019s and Susan works 40, she\u2019ll make more than me.At my job, I\u2019m paid hourly plus 15% of each job after I hit my goal. If I work saturdays, take extra jobs during the week, and don\u2019t take time off I can make a shit load more money if someone shows up for 40 hours a week.If they can come up with a stat that shows men make more than women in the same position, same experience, with the same hours worked, at the same company, then we can talk.","1388":"I agree that womens issues have to be talked about when refering to sexism.However so do mens? They definitely could have included more examples and stats on issues men face, as these aren't talked about nearly enough. And should definitely have picked better examples than journalism and verbal abuse.

Yes I know the sugar pills are medically unnecessary and were simply included to mimic natural cycles. But there has also been little to no research on the side effects of taking the pill continuously. These pills can have some pretty serious side effects and the doctor is basically telling women to take a 25% higher dose than intended, often with absolutely no extra physical checkup or follow up. There have been no long term high population studies on women who take the pill as intended vs skipping the sugar pill.

They just didn\u2019t have the same connection and butt heads a lot. My sister notoriously dates bad boys and\/or losers. She admits this herself.

I told them I didn\u2019t want my parents to know. Just my luck, my dad was there for a nose bleed, they saw me in the hall. Did a rape kit, for some medication to prevent HIV, took plan B and then gave a statement to the police. It took over a year to go trial. Met with a victim service worker who wasn\u2019t very helpful and with the crown attorney a few times. A private investigator followed me around a few times and tried to question me and people I knew about me to get dirt on me. I was bullied really badly in high school and got into drugs and drinking. Lost a lot of friends and my family split. In the end one guy was plead guilty and was given 3 years (only because he was 26 and had raped 10 other girls, most minors) and the other got off with nothing. He ended up walking around town with a knife trying to find me but the cops got him and I had a restraining order put against him. I regret coming forward personally but I can see how it would be positive for some people. For me it just dragged out the experience and caused a lot more problems. Unfortunately I was sexually assaulted again at 21 and I\u2019ve never told anyone and never will.","1568":"All about context. I had an elderly Japanese lady complimenting my height and hair in a bathroom once.

In therapy I wanted to find out why I chose him to marry so I wouldn't repeat the mistake.

That was 34 years ago and my life has been way better than I ever imagined it could be.

By doing them instead of being afraid of being shamed. Women are essentially taking back the power of their bodies etc.*However*, there are ways it can be seen as there still being exploited.Women who share their nudes openly and willingly, or take part in porn (e.g. only fans) is pushed as being empowering. But ultimately, they're still just being sexualised by men. What women share will be used by men for sexual gratification. So is this not women still being sexually exploited but they're made to believe its empowering?The same can be applied to women being more open with casual sex. It is seen as empowering because they're taking control of their sexuality, they're defying the slut shaming and going out there and doing what they want.But then there is the orgasm gap between men and women, meaning when women hook up, they're likely to leave without ever having an orgasm, but he almost always finishes. So we say women hooking up is sexually empowering...but...they're not being pleased, only he is. So are women not just being exploited still, but we are just made to believe by society that it is something we want in the name of empowerment? *Conclusion* It all depends on your personal view of things.- women sharing nudes is sexually empowering because they're claiming back power.- women sharing nudes is sexually exploiting them still because those photos are going to be used for mens sexual gratification. Thus they are still being exploited by men, and are \"empowered\" to keep sharing all so men can be benefitted more easily.","1576":"That's horrible","1577":"Exactly, so many dudebros hide behind a cursory \u201cit\u2019s just dark humour!!!!!\u201d, but there\u2019s no actual punch line.

I've been working at my first job for a few months now. It has been wonderful, everyone I met try their best to be inclusive, and the company truly cares about diversity and equal opportunities and it shows.Except... I've started to notice that a colleague (Guy A) that works very closely to me (and also considered by me a not-so-close 'friend') tends to say discriminating things very subtly.I've had someone say something quite rude to me when I started work, and at that time I couldn't control my emotions (read: tears) so I just left the room. I'm in good terms with that person but this Guy A has been telling other people that he's scared to ask me for help because I'll react that way.If I look at myself objectively, I used to be hot headed sometimes, but gosh, I've never shouted, snapped, made a rude\/snarky comment to anyone in the co. If anything I thought I adore the people I work with so I was always careful with how I react. If I feel like crying, I'll just walk out saying I'm unwell or something, although that never even happened twice.I try not to be too close to this guy despite us sharing mutual friends because of the kind of rude remarks he makes. He once got upset that someone said something 'feminist' during a large event (context - someone said thank you for including female characters in an exercise we were doing...). He downright asked me if I had plastic surgery (first person to ask me that). He told me my job and my role is not very core to the team while he's is. He believes in the 'girls bringing girls down' narrative and subtly tries to pit girls against each other by comparing their looks. He asks me \"how much did you buy *something \"fancy\" like a Starbucks drink*\" with a judgemental tone.But I've been noticing a more disturbing thing he's doing recently which is framing women around her who show emotions (negative ones especially) or speak up assertively as \"scary\" and hard to approach. I've also noticed that he likes girls who are super nice and smiley as friends and judges girls who may not smile all the time or express their preferences.Do I want to be his friend? I can pass. Do I want to confront him? Hard pass. But we have so many mutual friends and it's such a tightly knit community that I can't avoid him forever. Oh, and we work together. What surprises me the most is that I brushed off most of these red flags so far and actually thought that he was a good friend, a good 'bro' material.How do I deal with these kind of people?","1600":"This is so amazing!","1601":"Short answer: No.     Long answer: Either breasts on men AND women should be censored or neither should be.

Most importantly, I think if you want to get past the vaginas negative connotation, speak to your gynecologist about the purpose and complexity of it. Vaginas, while its visual appearance may be off-putting at first, are incredibly complex and amazing. As a woman it's so important to know that part of your body, not because of it's purpose but because of our own empowerment. Orgasms and masturbation can be empowering, too, but only do what you're comfortable with. The V Book by Dr. Elizabeth Stewart could be a good start for you.

I feel I've been able to make progress with people in my life on these kinds of issues by just talking to them about it and by trying to gently guide them to another perspective on the issue.

Here in Japan, in many households, a father is still the most dominant role in a family, whereas his wife and children are just dismissed as the members of his household. Very little individuality is given to them. A father doesn't nurture, but control us. Not a few men are cruel and sadistic, but they need to cover those traits in order to blind victims and achieve their goal (power, control, exploitation and whatever), so patriarchy is a cunningly-made structure to satisfy such a male covert narcissist's ambition for prestige, position and power through his using the cover of serving his family and ministering to the NEEDS of his wife and children (the weak), when actually the needs are created by patriarchy (such as... many rapists are at large, so wives can't walk alone on streets late at night, and they need a ride from their hubbies; the male-dominant media nurtures\/encourages pedophiles, and children need protection). This guard\/guardian role of a father gives him a fertile ground for his covert aggression. He is underhanded, so doesn't beat or hit his subordinates (wife and children), but damn makes sure we have less faith in ourselves, feel less confident, and inferior to him, through everyday covert put-downs and countless enforced standards.","1628":"No lol","1629":"Sure.

I am not one of you, don't message me.This is very difficult for me to discuss.I am a cis straight male, I was raised from the ages of 4 - 15 by a progressive feminist lesbian in central Indiana.She is the source of a lot of my progressive values, such as being pro-choice, secular, enviotmentalist, pro-animal rights, a supporter of the LBGTQA community, and feminism itself.I had attended many gay pride parades before my 12th birthday and I would volunteer at the AIDS hospice my mother worked at.I never, and still do not, felt any shame for being from a homosexual family. I wasn't educated that the world outside our home was not as liberal, especially after we moved away from Indianapolis, as my household was. Therefore I was unprepared for the instant isolation that came about when I revealed to my peers in the small central Indiana school that I had two mothers. It did not go well, I instantly became the target for homophobic bullies, including the closest thing I had to a best friend. I attempted to make new friends, but the stigma of being the kid with the lesbo parents stuck, till the only person who would still talk to me was the kid with the locker next to mine, I eventually stopped talking to any if my peers at that school after that kid showed everyone else the invitation to my 12th birthday party I had put in his locker (I was given over 30 and I only have out one), he and the rest were laughing at how \"funny\" it was that I would actually believe that anyone would accept such an invitation. Things got better when we moved to an even smaller town, but this time, armed with my past social disasters, I kept my home life secret, I even made friends and had a girl ask me out (though I was so surprised by this that I said no before I understood what she had said), even the bullies at the school liked me. Then the house we lived in was condemned due to very dangerous wiring and we moved again (I attended 21 different schools before I was 18), the bad thing was that we moved to the same school district I attended before.This was the death blow to my social life. I completely shut down, I never made another friend or girlfriend and became terrified of my peers, by the time we had moved once again, I no longer had any social skills, I did not know how to make friends, this was severely compounded by another big struggle of my youth.The progressive feminist lesbian parent that had shaped the very core of my value system and made me so liberal, was a severe misandrist.I know this is a horrid stereotype that is thrown out by misogynists, homophobes, and other far-right bigots, but she honestly was a very prejudiced woman, she had her reasons for being this way, she suffered horrific abuses by men in HER youth (I will not tell those stories, sorry, they are her trauma and it is not my place to share them).She would constantly insult all men, even gay ones, in the house, throughout my childhood. If she saw an attractive woman walking with a man, it would disgust her and she would rant about it at length. She took me and my sister out of our school (my sister was 8) because she firmly believed that my sister would be gang-raped by her classmates if she kept us in public schools (she quickly gave up teaching us and we went back to public school after yet another move).As I grew up she started directing her hate towards me. She would call me over to inform me that she and my mother were never going to break up, despite the fact that I had never said anything to the contrary, I loved her and didn't want any seperation, but she felt that I must have secretly wished this because I was turning into a man.She always treated my sister better, she forgave her mistakes and came down harsh on mine. I spent most of the time from 10 - 14 grounded, and even when I had friends, I was forbidden from staying at their house or inviting them over.She would still insult other people of my gender and sexual orientation, not caring about how this would affect me as the only male in the house. She would tell me that I was destined to be a horrible person because I was going to grow up to be a man, and once it became clear that I was straight, the insults and dark predictions got worse.She hated my father and would always fight against my mother to stop us from seeing him. She would often hit me, she threw things at me in anger, ince throwing a hard back book at me so hard that it dropped me to the ground and left a bruise that lasted for over a month on my left thigh, she treated me like I was born a sex offender, this made puberty even harder than it already was with how socially isolated I was.This crippled my self-esteem, depression controlled my life for over a decade before I started to understand the source of my mental health problems and work to combat them.I despised my gender, I could never talk to any girl or woman I was interested in because I believed that I was so far beneath them that nothing I could offer could ever be good enough for any woman to overlook the evil that was my gender. My sexuality was also a source of shame, I believed that it was wrong for women to be with men, putting another hurdle in my path to a romantic relationship.This woman is the source for both my highly progressive ideals and the suffocating self-loathing that still plagues my life.I have no friends, no partner either. The internet has helped me out alot in expanding my social life, I have discovered interests like anime and I am active in their online communities.However I still suffer from all the insecurities the hate I was raised with. As I write this I am both terrified and deeply depressed, I wasn't even going to write this tonight because the torment was overwhelming me.Now I do know the point of this subreddit, I do has something I want to ask.I have often searched for any advice on how to overcome the pains of my childhood, but I never make it far.There are two types of discussions regarding misandrists common online.Men calling all feminists radical \"Feminazis\", call same sex parents unfit, homosexuality is a sin, and all the various disgusting vomit everyone on this subreddit are already very familiar with.Then there is the other side, the side that is supposed to support victims of gender shaming, but they don't, look up misandry and the vast majority of results will be feminists arguing that men cannot be victims of gender oppression. Articles declaring that calling misandry hate speech is dangerous and that it will lead to a massive outbreak in violence against women. That acts of hate should be punished differently based on the gender of the victim.Some even say that hate crimes should not extend to acts against men.These are the top results, go to stories of men such as me that are victims of misandry and you will often see multiple angry responses from feminists that accuse the man of being the real bigot, that he should have thought of HER pain, that the very idea of men being the victim of sexism was laughable, that somehow the abusive woman could always be justified in any so called \"abuse\" she gave.I have attempted suicide.I have hurt myself due the still present depression, I go to therapy to help. When I see such views being so common and mostly unopposed by the feminist movement, it is VERY painful. It seems to confirm the hate I and many other men suffered from.Abuse that many boys today suffer from around the world.I can garuntee you all one thing, that if I had read any of these discussions when I was younger, my suicide attempt would have succeeded. They would have been the final plunge into despair and I don't see me having the strength to keep living.Now, there are men and boys out there today suffering far worse than what I experienced, boys like I was, scared to reach out, lacking any real support, boys that get pulled into the hate-groups of the far and alt-right after reading and hearing hate unabashedly spread about a trait they had no choice in.So here is what I want to ask feminists.If I nearly (very very nearly) took my own life out of feeling I was born evil, what do you imagine some boy that has suffered turmoil I can't fathom encounters these discussions? Especially if he is a progressive like myself, some one that supports feminism, equal pay, is pro-choice, and despises bigotry, traits that mean the only support for our emotional abuse mostly denies that abuse such as our can exist or even worse, attack us and perpetuate the feeling of self loathing instilled on us by our abusers, even going so far as to say they we MUST be the abusers, that are abuser was justified in what they did, that we just misunderstood.2nd question:Do you think that feminists need to work on recognizing misandry and being more welcome to those that seek aid after suffering as a result of it?I know it is hard. I know that the hate comes from men depressingly often.That the hate is far more prevalent on the other side and the fight to defeat the patriarchy is still very much needed.I know that victim mentality is EVERYWHERE among those, such as myself, with privledged positions in western society, but denying the very existence of male victims and trying to say that misandry can be justified is literally killing people. I garuntee that a boy or man has come here and other places like this seeking support and what they found led to them taking their own life. It almost happened to me.Please help me and others like me, progressives are supposed to be the better people, if we are who we say we are, then we should not be afraid to recognize our own failings and we should always work to end their influence.When a man comes forward and he believes himself to be a victim, do not assume that he lack understanding of victimhood. When a feminist denies the existence of misandry, we need to stop ignoring it.We are incredulous when we see the right deny misogyny, enforced gender roles, rape culture, other forms of gender inequality, racial injustice, religious intolerance, and all the various fucked up stances of the conservatives among us.They are blind to the extent hatred has infected their world, they declare the #MeToo movement as overblown, or believing Black Lives Matter to be the same as the Klu Klux Klan.Our side suffers from similar blindness of our own evils, it is far stronger than many of us are aware and ignoring it is literally killing people.This, writing this was very painful and I cannot avoid feeling dread of receiving a level of hate I can't cope with, but I truly feel this needs to be discussed, both for the unfortunate victims, and those among us that are blind to the pain and hate they are feeding.I hope you see me as a comrade in arms and not an enemy soldier, and understand that I tried very hard to not speak ignorance here, and can forgive me for anything I was wrong about.It is my sincerest desire that all of your days are as full of meaning and happiness as is possible and you have my deepest gratitude for reading my thoughts For ease I have repeated my queries below:1st question:If I nearly (very very nearly) took my own life out of feeling I was born evil, what do you imagine some boy that has suffered turmoil I can't fathom is both shunned from conservative society and vilified by progressive society?2nd question:Do you think that feminists need to work on recognizing misandry and being more welcome to those that seek aid after suffering pain as a result of it?","1632":"You can check on wikip\u00e9dia.

More specifically, the notion of woman as enchantress is one that recurs in images such as Circe Offering the Cup to Ulysees (1891, Oldham Art Gallery) and Hylas and the Nymphs (1896, Manchester City Art Gallery). His oeuvre also includes a number of middle-eastern subjects, in which he drew on the work of contemporary artists such as J.F Lewis (1805-76) and Lawrence Alma-Tadema (1836-1912), rather than on actual experience. This is one of Waterhouse's earlier works and reflects his fascination with the exotic.The woman in this picture appears to be a witch or priestess, endowed with magic powers, possibly the power of prophecy. Her dress and general appearance is highly eclectic, and is derived from several sources: she has the swarthy complexion of a woman of middle-eastern origin; her hairstyle is like that of an early Anglo-Saxon; her dress is decorated with Persian or Greek warriors. In her left hand, she holds a crescent-shaped sickle, linking her with the moon and Hecate. With the wand in her right hand, she draws a protective magic circle around her. Outside the circle the landscape is bare and barren; a group of rooks or ravens and a frog - all symbols of evil and associated with witchcraft - are excluded. But within its confines are flowers and the woman herself, objects of beauty.The meaning of the picture is unclear, but its mystery and exoticism struck a chord with contemporary observers. When the picture was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1886 the critic for the Magazine of Art wrote 'Mr. Waterhouse, in The Magic Circle, is still at his best - original in conception and pictorial in his results' (quoted in Hobson, p.37).","1802":"I\u2019m a former exotic dancer with an MA, a successful career and a side hustle in politics","1803":"and all those sluggers went down like lead.","1804":"So so beautiful \ud83d\ude0d","1805":"Beauty \ud83d\udc97","1806":"This is beautiful!

He didn\u2019t have much money, but he had a wealth of wild stories that he used to tell me from his younger days. He also loved poetry. Any topic that came up in conversation - he\u2019d be able to recite something related. My favourite stories of his came from the time he spent in the USA and Mexico in his 20\u2019s (1950\u2019s).It\u2019s a long story, but to break it down: he joined the Canadian army and went AWOL a few months later with some friends of his. They spent the next two years travelling south. He used to talk about how he worked at fairgrounds in Chula Vista and how he also visited a childhood pen-pal who worked on a ranch in Texas.Eventually he was arrested near the Mexican border and deported back to England. The police apparently assumed he and his friends were illegal immigrants... which they were...I guess, but just not from Mexico. As I said, it\u2019s quite a long story.He passed away last summer. He\u2019d had dementia for several years, and he had already forgotten who I was about 5 years ago. I was still sad that I couldn\u2019t visit him in hospital due to COVID. The care home he was living in cruelly threw away all of his possessions the day after he died before my parents could go and collect his things. My Dad managed to salvage one of his poetry books and a framed photo from the tip. Everything else was gone or ruined.He didn\u2019t have much money, but he\u2019s left me just a little bit. From that I would like to get something handmade from the region of the world that he loved so much. Just to remind me of him and his stories.I was hoping someone here may be familiar with traditional folk artists or crafts people?

We really need to get more people in charge of social media that will shut lies like that down quickly. Tumblr and Reddit needs it more so. People want to act like they're being censored and their free speech is being taken away just because social media companies cal out their lies and ban their bigotry, but oh fucking well.

On one hand I can understand the need of uplifting an identity that is too often ignored or hyper criticized. But, I think that Beyonce being uplifted kind of shows the way that sexist and colorist ideals work within the black community. Beyonce would probably not be as famous if she was darker skin and didn\u2019t play into the male gaze to sell her music. I also wonder how much her parents, getting into the business so young, and being apart of the rap\/R&B scene during the era of misogynist rappers and singers such as R Kelly affected her own views.I was reading Demita Frazier (member of the Combahee River Collective) and her comments about Beyonce were eye opening. Frazier said that Beyonce is promoting sex positivity but if your a feminist the conversation should be ongoing and focus on other avenues as well such as devoting more money to educating young black girls or addressing misogyny in rap\/R&B. Beyonce seems to have some feminist views but a lot of it seems clouded by overarching black liberation thinking (which still caters more to the liberation of black men).I wish the black community could uplift more females like Tierra whack or noname who talk about issues facing all types of black people without having to play into the jezebel stereotype that has haunted black women. But, too many people rather listen to artists who don\u2019t really support the community which makes it harder to have conversations on issues affecting the community such as sexual violence. Also, we are already aware of how difficult it is for conscious black rappers and singers to make it in the mainstream because their thinkings have not been accepted by that same audience. I wonder why artists that only focus on sex, drugs, and money are more likely to be favored in mainstream society then people speaking about the obstacles they face like rap and R&B use to be.So, I guess the hate you received will probably be ongoing but just know that it is very common. Happens a lot to black women and black queers who dare to question the community that doesn\u2019t understand the way that modern society views on gender, sexuality, and class have affected it own community\u2019s views.","1857":"Signal boost tf out of this","1858":"is it ok to ask *if* they want to get pregnant?","1859":"Classic gaslighting.

Thanks for sharing!","1899":"As long as they're vegetarian \"wings\", I'll bring the Boone's Farm Strawberry Hill.","1900":"So....regular Tuesday programming is not canceled due to Election Day! F yeah!Self care needed more this Tuesday but glad for the regular Tuesday self-care schedule to remain intact.","1901":"Did you paint that??","1902":"Me! Me! Robbie, Big Sur. Thank you, can use all the help I can get.","1903":"at least you have a cat and nintendo and reddit to keep you company ;)","1904":"One person's kink is another's weirdness.","1905":"That switch can be done in 10 minutes or less","1906":"I love all the Addams Family Au\/ text posts. Edit: my loveable cat jumped on my lap and headbutt my phone so I had a bunch of typos","1907":"TIL I'm attracted to weather radar maps","1908":"I hate when I get washed with Brian\u2019s.","1909":"She gave a speech at the 1893 world fair advocating women in the sciences. Of course she studied space, she was too far ahead of the rest of the world to study anything else.","1910":"Disgraceful","1911":"And of course she's getting harassing PMs. Can't speak the truth without pissing off the #notallmen mob. Really wish they would put as much effort in promoting respect for women as they do in arguing #notallmen.","1912":"True lol","1913":"Thank you for the great suggestions.","1914":"And that ad link to the next story below it: \"SEE ALSO: How to raise boys so they're comfortable with their emotions\". Serendipity.","1915":"Oh.my.gosh. I feel like America needs saving!","1916":"Do you mean in a therapeutic sense? If so, I've spoken to my child self as kindly as I speak to my children. I give her metaphorical hugs. I tell her it's ok to not be constantly serving others. My therapist also does some of this for me, as well.","1917":"Lets see. My old husband..... At the least once a week. If not way more for years till I finally got brave enough to leave. My current fianc\u00e9.... Maybe once? Maybe.... And I think it was mostly cause I was hormonal as hell and I didnt feel he was taking me seriously when he was. He's definitely hurt my feelings before but I cant remember a solid time he has done so purposely or repeatedly yet alone bad enough for me to even remember crying.","1918":"I love to have an overall healthy lifestyle and I think it is really important, personally. I like to wake up at 5:30am and meditate, then workout. On Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday I do 45 minutes to an hour of (usually) vinyasa yoga. I'll follow a yoga video, with my favoutite channel being \"Breathe and Flow\".On Monday, Wednesday and Friday I do a full-body workout, which usually consists of five to six movements that incorporate the seven primal movements. Push, pull, squat, lunge, hinge (at the hips), twist and an animal movement (or walk\/run). These full-body workouts are bodyweight movements or I'll add in fabric resistance bands (which I love) to make the movement harder. I'm not a fan of weights, though I applaud anyone that does them, that's badass.For cardio, I am not a fan of high-intensity cardio, I much prefer walks\/hiking. So that's what I do, walking\/hiking, and I'll always take my dog with me (I feel safer with her). I usually go for a 30+ minute walk in the afternoon. The one thing I love about a healthy lifestyle is that you can adjust it to what you want to do. If you don't like weights, don't do them. If you love yoga, do that! Maybe doing a sport is for you. It's just about finding a good strength and cardio training regime and a balanced diet. Have a lovely day!","1919":"People expecting me to know how to fix and do everything whenever their is a problem.Oh and people thinking I'm a dumb twelve year old and not an adult.","1920":"My bf invented my nickname by combining my name and my dog's name, because we're a package deal. It's pretty much the only way he refers to me, and I love it so much.","1921":"A backed mac and cheese dish that has been going on for ages. My dad also has this shrimp and salmon recipe that everyone loves.","1922":"He trained to be a police officer and once he started work after just 6 months of training (compared to up to 3 years in Europe) he hated it. But because they had paid for his training, he wanted to stay for 2 years, in order not to have to pay for it. So my husband turned against me, because I was happy in my job, and abused me verbally, emotionally, and financially.","1923":"This is one of my biggest peeves ever. I'm ok with gender-neutral \"guys\", but in general I prefer \"folks\". Still, tons and tons of people will say \"guys\/girls\", like in clothing stores and whatnot, and it really gets under my skin. If you're going for something colloquial, it should at least be \"gals\".If you try to go the other way and turn it into \"boys\/girls\", guess who gets upset.","1924":"I love her! She looks badass.","1925":"As a Marxist, I believe that even sex work is \"real work\" and that's why it needs to be abolished! After all, what happens at sweatshops and iPhone factories are real work as well and they're incredibly degrading. All forms of wage labor are exploitative to one degree or another. When the commodity is your own body, this is doubly true. And as a trans person, the term \"SWERF\" annoys me because it's made to sound like \"TERF.\" TERFs spread pseudo-science about trans people and have a vitriolic hatred of trans women, and most so-called SWERFs are nothing like that towards sex workers! Not to mention that the pornography industry exploits and fetishizes trans women and normalizes transphobic languge about us. Trans women are forced into the sex work because of our dire poverty and very few trans women would say that it's any kind of \"empowering\" experience.","1926":"I never understood the whole \"oh absolutely can't interact with women or they might claim I raped them!\"It's stupidYes there are some shitty people out there, but you should be able to treat us pike humans? Like don't go hugging up on me when I don't know you, don't touch me without asking, and we'll be fine","1927":"There is a subset of men who have a deep sense of entitlement to the attention and affection of women.  They seem oblivious to the fact that a woman might not find him attractive or not be interested. A lot of men are not like this, and those ones are worth getting to know.","1928":"Did you have your heart broken or something bro??  It seems like you alienate yourself from women for a reason...","1929":"Marital rape is not even a crime in India, but it needs to be.","1930":"My Zsa Zsa crossed over almost 5 months ago. I didn\u2019t think the sharp pain would ever end. The daily tears and anger. But somehow now i can look at her photos and just smile. I miss her every day but it\u2019s gotten easier. I didn\u2019t think it would. Hang in there. Your beautiful baby is still with you.","1931":"She looks like she\u2019s about to tell a Space Grape \u201cYou took everything from me\u201d","1932":"This reminds me of the Bison traffic jams, I've been to yellowstone multiple times for a Vacation and something you learn pretty quickly is that one of the Bisons favorite activities is walking on the road through the park and causing 10 minute traffic jams.Nobody cares and you just oogle the 1.5 ton mammals.","1933":"Extra hot to scald away my sins","1934":"So cool! How does one know their birth element?","1935":"Fuck, that is good.","1936":"Thank you for voting! I'm in AZ and was so proud of you fellow witches for helping flip us blue. It feels like for the first time in 4 years there's actually hope for a kinder future","1937":"I feel his pain. Not the $3 million part. But my ex-wife did steal my dog. been fighting for about 4 months to get her back. And it has been expensive.","1938":"For comparison 700+ men have been hanged (2019 data)","1939":"I wish I didn't have teeth, then I wouldn't have to clean my teeth.","1940":"Who tf cares that much about *street names*?","1941":"Can someone help me understand the term \"shadowbanned\"?  I've been on Reddit for a while but I guess I'm still new here.","1942":"This seems to be somewhat hypocritical in that she states how we need to be so considerate of women, yet she lumps many men together as to be a low quality and has unequal expectations for men as to be 'gentlemen'. The whole article is somewhat inconsistent and contradictive, without a sound basis or any sincere mutual consideration for men.","1943":"\" Even her request to the council to pay back the cost of toys for Dylan was declined, the court heard. \"  0\\_0 she murdered her kid and then tried to get a refund on the accessories","1944":"Britney Spears - DUH!","1945":"\"Why do you have to be such a bitch?\"Said to me by my good friend in high school. I was section leader of the percussionists in band, and I was telling him to play his instrument properly because he was being lazy. He was probably having a bad day and I didn't realize it. But it still hurt that he lashed out at me","1946":"I am extremely pro casual sex. I believe the pressure women face to make every sexual encounter some huge meaningful thing is a ridiculous standard. I'm not saying go out and fuck any and everybody but if you like someone physically and connect with them on that level there is nothing wrong with being intimate with them. Use protection & open communication with anyone who you are engaging with. As for me I've had partners where we both knew it was strictly casual sex and it was great through out the whole thing","1947":"BlackNavy blueCharcoal Grey","1948":"Got a perfect score on my PSAT!","1949":"That my career does not define me, nor my gender, my appearance, my material possessions, or anything else projected onto me by others.","1950":"I can adapt very easily and I learn quickly. This is great for when I\u2019m starting a new job. No one usually asks me how, but employers and coworkers will often comment on how quick I pick up things.Also, I love reading all these replies and learning about everyone\u2019s little superpowers. :)","1951":"Also, rape scenes get lower censorship than sex scenes that show women having orgasms.","1952":"As part of my doctorate in Counselling Psychology, I am writing my dissertation on individuals\u2019 experiences of post-abortion counselling. I\u2019ve received ethical approval from my university and I\u2019m now looking to conduct interviews with individuals who have received counselling as abortion aftercare. The aim of this study is to find out more about what is and isn\u2019t helpful for individuals receiving counselling after terminating a pregnancy. It\u2019s hoped that this research will inform clinician awareness and the provision of appropriate support services for individuals who have terminated their pregnancies.If you have had post-abortion counselling and would be interested in learning more and potentially having a conversation with me, please [fill out this form](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/forms\/d\/e\/1FAIpQLSdiW1tw0hsUA98lddb3vTZP7w_Kcnp_kYJKkvMdWqJI_WjTfg\/viewform) and I'll reach out to you! Thank you!","1953":"I am from a south asian household and one of the most significant way patriarchy is enforced is, a man always accompanies me when I am traveling for hours in a rented car. Though I put up a fight, they barely listen and I am left with no other choice but to be okay with having a man traveling with me \"for my safety\" and no, they never trust the driver enough. My ex partner said if I really was a feminist I would have found alternative ways to travel and wouldn't have relied on them even if that will ensue extreme drama and family tension and inconvenience on my behalf. On the side note, I am always calling out my family for their sexist remarks and instill my opinions through rigourous debates, sometimes which turn to be fruitful. Am I enforcing patriarchy by not trying hard enough?","1954":"Not surprised that is is by Chimamanda. What an absolute queen I have so much respect","1955":"I disagree with the Hyena and police uniform ones - very fashionable at any age!","1956":"Nice sentiment.  Cute shirt.  It will make you a target for abuse.  The irony is barely worth noting it's so ubiquitous though.","1957":"I'm aware that there's bigger issues out there but why did someone feel the need to make r\/holdmycosmo after r\/holdmybeer?It's the same fucking principle but it makes this stupid assumption that all men like beer and women don't like beer aswell as the assumption that all women just walk around with a cosmo or something. Maybe I read into too much but I just think it's an example of unnecessary gendering","1958":"If it is going to be a small bottle or resin amulet, I would think maybe you could layer some black salt, dried lavender, aloe, and willow leaves, then perhaps some sunflower seeds on top.","1959":"Oops I read this as \"I miss my rabies...\" And had to do a double take \ud83e\udd23 love the mug and your rat babies, too!","1960":"May you be blessed, may her heart be restored, and may your family's relationships likewise be restored.","1961":"\"Hold still, damnit!\"","1962":"I\u2019m not POC so I can\u2019t imagine what they went through, but I\u2019m a tall curvy white woman. I used to starve myself and bleach my hair until it broke to fit the look.

Thread removed.","1967":"I get tattooed a lot and there's a lot of stories coming out right now in the UK about male artists with successful careers in the industry sexually abusing female clients and I actually consider myself lucky that this hasn't happened to me. It shouldn't be this way.","1968":"Hey everyone,I work at a restaurant and have for a couple years. A co worker only addressed me as \u201chey beautiful\u201d, \u201cwhat\u2019s up gorgeous\u201d, \u201cwhat\u2019s up good lookin\u201d. First of all I feel like this is totally inappropriate at the workplace. Also totally a gender thing, imagine if every time I saw a male corker that\u2019s how I addressed them? I don\u2019t want to sound rude but I really don\u2019t like these names. Anyone have any advice on how to tell him without being an asshole ?","1969":"It seems bizarre someone would make that assumption, as if some can't imagine a place for women's bodies outside sex . . . And I don't see how something having ancient roots legitimises it. Murder has ancient roots. You don't find people legitimising murder on that basis. It's ridiculous, and just an attempt to manipulate women, as usual, into accepting  justification that's really no justification even if it were true.&#x200B;This is really cool though, and quite interesting in showing how our tastes are affected by circumstance. I remember somewhere that it used to be normal to find a very nourished woman as the ideal until we started over-consuming . . .then being skinny became the in-thing for women. So it actually turns out to be evidence against those industries . . .","1970":"Male here, 'Bro code' is garbage. When I talk to other guys, that kind of language is a big red flag.Usually comes with some sort of \"number ranking\" outlook. Bro code dude will have a very articulate opinion about \"8's\", as if that's a real life thing","1971":"India is absolute hell for women. I've seen the brutality first hand with women in my house.Rape and domestic violence\/\/ My own father has beaten and raped my mother and no one did anything except slide it under the rug and gaslight her to stay in the marriage. The women are treated like trash and property. It's even worse in places with high crime rate like Kashmir valley which is always under the threat of terrorism. Now these there's a religious war going on between Hindus and Muslims. Both trying to use women to have as many kids as possible to get the majority. Radicalised Hindus who parrot same bs their religious leaders say on Twitter and then claim We ReSpEct WoMeN. They're even opposing feminism because ReLiGiOn iS gReAt and anyone who questions them is considered an outsider and a direct threat to the religion.As a man, I tried to do whatever I can to help the women around me but got backlash because I should be a \"good man\".
