Not having student loan debt. I am also very fortunate and have never had any, but I have recognized the privilege of that and have strived to do things to make my parents investment worthwhile (I focused on school and got good grades, still tried to work for extra money, I saved like hell to prepare me for my post-grad life, etc). I see many other people who are very privileged in this way essentially throw away the opportunity by taking lavish vacations, getting an overpriced car or house, etc. rather than setting themselves up for a good future. By their 30's they'll be further behind than those with student loans because they have no self-control and/or financial literacy.	1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f0e7b38e2f73c3f0fd8b4	00016b18b2--608f0e7b38e2f73c3f0fd8b4	APPROVED

me. god me. i was friends with this girl for years. we met because she was the best friend of the girl my ex cheated on me with. their friendship fell apart and eventually we started talking. and that fell into us hanging out all the time and being on facetime all the time since we were both homeschooled. and for some insight she is the type to literally never be single. i think the entire time we were friends she was single for a week all together. and she always liked douchy guys that always tried to hit on me when she wasn't around. or try talking/making plans with me and not involving her. which i never reciprocated because gross. and i would always try to confront her with the evidence and she would then confront them. and they always have some sob story and she believed them over me, every damn time. and they would turn against me and make her turn against me. and she always dropped me for them like clock work. went from hanging out and talking everyday to basically nothing. one of them ended up in the hospital and made her chose me or them. and she sent me screenshots saying she chose them. and then had the audacity to say it was fine and we would still talk. god it broke my heart. and then a couple weeks or months went by and she would come crawling back. and we were stuck in this stupid cycle for years. and i finally put my foot down and blew up on her about how bad of a friend she was. and she proceeded to blow up my phone while i was at work and leave threatening voice mails. and even showed up at my workplace multiple times but always on my days off. it was horrible. and i would never wish it on anyone. so been there! it gets better i promise.	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f0e7b38e2f73c3f0fd8b4	00016b18b2--608f0e7b38e2f73c3f0fd8b4	APPROVED
I believe in ghost because of this one time i was just trying to sleep i was downstairs (ps i was 12 and still am) and i was trying to sleep without my earbuds in because i like to have something on in the background when sleeping and that night i was like i won't have my earbuds in and that was the one of the worst things i have ever done i heard heavy breathing and if i looked at one place to long it would go black so i will never sleep without my earbuds and never downstairs	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f0edd4539ae2e03908d27	00016b18b2--608f0edd4539ae2e03908d27	APPROVED

I (28f) lost my brother (32) two years ago. It was a tragic work accident. At first the thoughts were haunting, and I didn’t think I would ever be able to stop hurting. I still don’t, but the pain has faded. It’s like your heart has been torn open, but as time goes on it begins to scar and fade. However, you know the pain is still there. Losing a sibling is a tough grief to overcome. You loved each other, hated each other, you grew together, there was envy and silliness. Laughs and tears. I feel like it’s one of the more honest relationship we have throughout our lives. You’re going to hurt, and that’s okay. But never forget to stop and laugh at the good memories too. I’ve learned to take them one at a time, and hope for the best. I’m sorry for your loss. Truly.	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f0edd4539ae2e03908d27	00016b18b2--608f0edd4539ae2e03908d27	APPROVED

I have very very thick, wavy hair.

"Oof... Definitely not listening to my gut instinct about people because I doubt my gut instinct. Every time my gut instinct tells me in the very beginning that something might be 'off', I seem to ignore it and hope things turn out different. It happened with a 'friend' who ended up raping me, with many jobs where the alarm bells said ""this seems not safe, you should leave"", etc. Happened again v recently and I'm facepalming a bit on the inside. Luckily the most recent time, it was merely incompatibility and there wasn't anything even remotely abusive. But, my gut definitely told me in the beginning that this wasn't going to be a match.

34, 43, and 48 are nonsense.Everything else is spot-on.I am a huge male right proponent and huge gender equality proponent. So please don't rally against me for my criticisms:34: Friendzones aren't a thing. It's called platonic attraction.43: Female bathrooms are disgusting. I've been inside them plenty of times because I have severe bowel maladies. I don't care enough about feelings or the filth to shit my pants in pain.48: it's just about tone. Music is subjective, and parts are written to be played with a certain tone.

I was fixing some cupboard doors in my gfs apartment and she thought it would be funny to come up behind me and kick me full force in the nads. I doubled over, threw up and now I swear my nuts are floating around somewhere in my stomach. She apologised after I got mad and said she didn't mean to do it hard and didn't think it would hurt bad but I'm pissed. Why do some people think this is ok? Clearly if I ever hurt her in any way it wouldn't be ok so why is it funny for her to hurt me? She advocates against violence against women so I find it a touch hypocritical.

"There's a lot of Western bias in this perspective.  I'll copy-paste a comment that I just left in another thread:Circumcision only causes no harm if you assume the foreskin and its functions have no value to its owner, which you simply cannot do on behalf of all men.  I could also justify routine double mastectomies, which would eliminate breast cancer and save half a million lives every year, if I disregard the value that breasts have to women.Regarding putting FGM in another category...again, that's cultural bias talking.Type IV FGM, which is performed in Indonesia and is the most common form of FGM worldwide, removes nothing from the girl's body.  [A study found](https://knowledgecommons.popcouncil.org/departments_sbsr-rh/34/) that 92% of Indonesian mothers support the practice, and only 2% say it isn't beneficial.  In Egypt, where the forms of FGM are more severe (Type I), [82% of women support continuing the practice](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3134892/), with a majority responding that it doesn't lessen sexual pleasure.  In Africa, [an anti-FGM task force](https://www.taskforcefgm.de/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/hast81.pdf) claims that in cultures that cut women:1. *""Research by gynecologists and others has demonstrated that a high percentage of women who have had genital surgery have rich sexual lives, including desire, arousal, orgasm, and satisfaction, and their frequency of sexual activity is not reduced.""*  - *""Many women who have had genital surgeries view the procedure as a cosmetic beautification, moral enhancement, or dignifying improvement of the appearance of the human body. This is true of both male and female genital modifications in African cultures.*""2. *""The widely publicized and sensationalized reproductive health and medical complications associated with female genital surgeries in Africa are infrequent events and represent the exception rather than the rule.""*3. *""Female genital surgeries in Africa are viewed by many insiders as aesthetic enhancements of the body and are not judged to be 'mutilations.'""*4. *""Female genital surgery in Africa is typically controlled and managed by women. Similarly, male genital surgery is usually controlled and managed by men. Although both men and women play roles in perpetuating and supporting the genital modification customs of their cultures, female genital surgery should not be blamed on men or on patriarchy.""*5. *""Demographic and health survey data reveal that when compared with men, an equal or higher proportion of women favor the continuation of female genital surgeries.""*The truth is, in cultures that cut girls, FGM is justified in a myriad of ways, often by the women in those cultures. There are also some health benefits:http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1113&context=iph_theseshttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/265824402_Female_Circumcision_and_HIV_Infection_in_Tanzania_for_Better_or_for_Worsehttps://www.jsm.jsexmed.org/article/S1743-6095(18)31387-0/abstractWe could justify FGM fairly easily. All we have to do is disregard a woman's right to bodily autonomy, and ignore the value a woman might place on these body parts.Likewise, for male circumcision, there are absolutely still people who still practice it to this day in an effort to curb sexual pleasure.  I've saved a list of quotes from Jewish leaders, since that hits particularly close to home for me:* [Chabad](https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1014930/jewish/The-Mitzvah-of-Circumcision-Part-I.htm) (Major Jewish organization)> It weakens sexual desire and pleasure, hopefully giving a person more  strength to restrain himself from engaging in forbidden sexual  encounters. In a similar vein, Nachmanides writes that the *brit* reminds us to only use the male organ in a permissible and positive way.* [Rabbi Jonathan Sacks](http://rabbisacks.org/the-eighth-day/) (UK chief rabbi)> Circumcision symbolises the idea that there is something higher than nature. Passing on our genes to the next generation should not simply be a blind instinct, a Darwinian drive. The Abrahamic covenant was based on sexual fidelity, the sanctity of marriage, and the consecration of the love that brings new life into the world.* [Ritual Well](https://ritualwell.org/ritual/blood-and-men) (Canadian Reform rabbi)> Circumcision functions not only as ritual initiation but also as the communal ritual setting of boundaries to male sexuality. At the brit milah male blood is the metaphor for discipline and control over the ultimate male lack of control: unbounded and dangerous sexuality.* Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan (from link above)> The covenant of circumcision was one of the things that elevated Abraham and his children from the fallen state resulting from the expulsion from Eden. As a result of this covenant, the sexual act of the Jew enters the realm of the holy, and partakes of man's optimum state before his expulsion.* [Jewish Agency](http://archive.jewishagency.org/nechama-leibowitz/content/23929) (largest Jewish organisation)> Accordingly, this precept fulfills an educational and disciplinary role in the relationship of man towards his Creator. It harbors a permanent warning against the sinful use of the organ of reproduction: it elevates carnal activity to the level of a mitzvah… (The article then goes on to approvingly cite Maimonides and others who praised sexually repression by circumcision)* [Times of Israel](https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/brit-milah-pinchas-and-cyprus/)> ...his reproductive organ is not simply going to be used for pleasure or Darwinian reproduction. Instead, it will be used to continue the divine relationship from gen...eration to generation. When we mark our 8-day-old sons’ male reproductive organs, we are passing them the obligation to use their reproductive will in the service of the divine relationship. We are instructing them, almost from birth, that they are responsible for the proper use of their reproductive will.* [Commentary magazine](https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/the-new-enemies-of-circumcision/)> Where much of contemporary American culture now places the highest valuation on pleasure, especially sexual pleasure, and on the avoidance of any sort of pain, the classical Jewish texts value the willingness to suffer for a worthy cause, speak of the sanctity of marriage, and elevate self-control over self-expression.* [Aish ha-Torah](https://www.aish.com/jl/l/b/What_is_Circumcision.html)> In addition, *Brit Milah* is done specifically on the site that is identified with our greatest physical desires, thus empowering us to rise above the demands of our bodies.* [Reform Judaism website](https://reformjudaism.org/learning/torah-study/lech-lcha/brit-milah-jewish-answer-modernity)> Judaism, on the other hand, is in many ways a rebellion against nature. Yes, we are told to care for the natural world, but we are also told to work hard to make it better―to repair it. \[...\]And that's why religion tries to control nature. Judaism teaches that the world as God gave it to us isn't good enough―we need to perfect it. Nature makes illness; we must find cures. Nature wired us with all kinds of base desires; we must control them. In nature, most of God's creatures behave like animals; we must be better.* [Moshe Friedman](http://nymohel.com/laws_customs.php), NY mohel> By physically removing the foreskin, we are spiritually removing and eliminating undesirable character traits, depressive tendencies and so on. We eliminate from the body of the child, forces which might try to cultivate overindulgence in physical pleasures, etc.Few other links: [1](https://embassies.gov.il/holysee/Relations/Pages/Corporeality.aspx), [2](http://www.jtsa.edu/the-mitzvah-of-circumcision), [3](https://www.vosla.org/brit-milah-naming), [4](https://torahclass.com/archived-articles/835-jewish-identity-and-the-torah-part-1-by-rabbi-baruch), [5](https://www.dallasobserver.com/news/prime-cut-6401547), [6](https://www.orthodox-jews.com/what-is-a-bris.html), [7](http://www.britpro.com/default.asp?p=bris), [8](https://www.brismilah.org/press/prime-cut-dallas-observer/)We've created a false dichotomy in the west based on comparing the most extreme consequences of FGM with the most palatable excuses for MGM.  In reality, FGM encompasses a broad spectrum of practices, for a variety of reasons and with a variety of outcomes, and much of the justification we apply to male circumcision is echoed by FGM proponents.To respond to some of your specific points:> most male circumcisions are done in hospitals or sterile environment with clean medical cutting tools, while most female genital mutilations are done out in the open with dirty non-medical cutting toolsWhy does the setting matter?  If a girl were circumcised in a hospital, would that suddenly be okay?  (Edit: according to UNICEF, [one in four FGM procedures were performed by a healthcare provider](https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/approximately-1-4-fgm-survivors-were-cut-health-care-provider).)Also, every country that cuts girls with ""dirty tools"" also cuts boys.> the equivalent to removing the foreskin in females would be the clitoral hoodThis is form Type Ia of FGM:https://www.who.int/teams/sexual-and-reproductive-health-and-research/key-areas-of-work/female-genital-mutilation/types-of-female-genital-mutilationAre you okay with removing a baby girl's clitoral hood if it's done in a hospital setting?"	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f0fb9dce1aa1bd00a0897	00016b18b2--608f0fb9dce1aa1bd00a0897	APPROVED

"Ask in some of the ""no politics here"" witch subs here and witch groups on Facebook, and  you will get a very different answer, in part because of the whole ""colonize spirituality"" thing that a lot of white women (and many white men) get into. They often don't realize they're extending their imperialist worldview to their faith/practice (or, indeed, that they *have* an imperialist worldview)—they call it cutesy bullshit like ""I'm an *eclectic* witch, teehee!"" while their practice willfully and knowingly stomps on POC and other minority groups. (Before anyone gets upset: **Full respect** to *real* eclectic witches who have done their homework and are not willfully causing harm with their practices. **I'm not calling y'all out.** I'm calling out Becky WhitePerson and her ""I don't care if it hurts Native feelings when I use sage, feathers, and abalone—it's *my* practice and I'll hurt everyone I want!"" mindset.)Being a witch is inherently political. Most of us chose to follow this calling, and choosing to be a witch is choosing to side with marginalized people and spirits—and choosing to marginalize yourself in many ways. How can you, as a marginalized person, stand by or actively support a political force that causes harm to marginalized people? The boot right-wingers lick will eventually step on whyte supremacist ""witches"" as much as it steps on everyone else—and your support won't save you…or at least, it won't while letting you keep your Craft alive. But as with all things, their logic never adds up."	1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f1060edc8e237c0d25ce7	00016b18b2--608f1060edc8e237c0d25ce7	APPROVED
Your dad was masked, and likely so was his colleague. I have been in an office twice this month with folks testing positive. We all were wearing masks and I have been negative. I test weekly for work. I’m also a healthcare worker. Colleagues and patients are testing positive near me left and right. It’s such a scary time. But it sounds like your dad is taking precautions seriously. I know it seems hopeless,  but we will get through it. Your dad was vaccinated today! So that’s a great start as well.

Tarot decks are one thing for focus, but you don't need them. All they began as were European playing cards. They are still just European playing cards in many cases. I saw my first tarot that way, being used by my Spanish grandfather and his friends.Before the 1960s, late, all card reading was done with poker decks. Look for older books to tell you what stood for what. It's the reader, not the cards, doing the work. (Even if collecting decks is one of my weak points. Love the art.)For that matter, I've designed two decks. They are my faves. Get a source on what they're supposed to mean, and make cards with a symbolism that works for you, that you can remember. Can't make pictures? Composite symbols in graphics programs or with old-school collage. Redesign them as you understand more. Like you, it can grow and improve.	1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f1060edc8e237c0d25ce7	00016b18b2--608f1060edc8e237c0d25ce7	APPROVED

It’s their decision. I would only try and “interfere” if there was something like physical abuse going on, but not liking or trusting them? Who cares if I like their friends or not? It is not my business.It’s not a direct commentary on me and I for darn sure don’t care if they don’t like mine, so why would it go the other way?Edit to add: if they asked my opinion on them, I would try to give it in a tactful way but I would be honest.

He would ask to walk me to and from school, he showered me with gifts, would tell on me to my parents if I didn’t give him extra attention and would come over my house several times per day when I wasn’t home and just sit outside or interrogate my family on where I was. He messaged me from every social media and made new ones whenever I blocked him (this was after my dad had to call the phone company and have his number blocked so he would stop texting me). He started having my friends leave me monster energy drinks during the school day, which I didn’t even like. He even showed up at my moms work once to ask her how I was and she didn’t even know him! I started seeing him stand outside of my house in the street sometimes just sort of wandering around outside my window and that’s when I got suuuuuper creeped out. I went outside one day and told him I didn’t like him and I was not ever going to like him with how he was acting. Next thing I knew he hated me and told all of our mutual friends I was a slut. By the time junior year came around he was still salty about it and occasionally I’d hear rumors he had spread about me. Once or twice throughout junior/senior year he messaged me saying he was sorry and still liked me. I saw him wandering outside my house a few more times. He offered to buy me more monsters, which I of course didn’t want, and when I turned them down he would get so sad and say something like “well, maybe someday....”. Ugh still creeps me out.	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f10ac3d2e6f2678c89a5f	00016b18b2--608f10ac3d2e6f2678c89a5f	APPROVED

Well, it took me a few years time as my self esteem was very low.  At first I blamed myself and I used to think that it was my fault that he left me. I would suggest you talk about this with someone you trust. They would be able to guide you and would help you think better   In my case, my best friend didn't support me, which decreased my self esteem, which could be the reason why it took years for me to get over him  Anyway, you are already aware that he/she is toxic, so that's a good first step  Just know that it wasn't your fault and that you deserve love and happiness  Hope you find a way soon.

Take notes of everything. You'll probably find many weird and illogical stuff on your first weeks. If you take notes about it, you can ask about it to better understand it  obviously, but that's not the true brilliant thing with this tip. People tend to do things out of habit and not question it, even if it's not always the most efficient way of doing it. With your fresh point of view, you can sometime notice those, and in a few month, find solution to improve it. It might take time, because you have to learn a bit more about how things work at your new job to get the bigger picture. Keep those notes and read them even a year into the job, and you might have a brilliant idea.

Here again , I gotta tell you  what she did to you was disgusting  and worst she is throwing her to you which is not your responsability whatsoever. Also, your social skills can be  improved but you have to take away that self loathing and start respecting yourself and loving yourself without narcisism. I guess she is using as a emotional baggage to her vindictive  and hatred towards you. The question is how self aware is she that she is doing that to you? Do you ever talk to her about this ? Try to talk to her and be assertive ( no , I am not talking being agressive or screaming or anything of that . Rather that learn  to respect others while respecting yourselves.  This self hatred won't t let you improve as a person. It self sabotage you. The reason you are being bully is because you do not put boundaries ( I also struggle on that)  and people do not like pushovers and people who do not stand their ground due that is consider weakness. Worst this behavior atract toxic people into your life.  I suggest to go to a phsycology, find a hobby, read philosophy,  and reflect what life do want as person and create your own purpose.  In regard to your mother,  if she continues to mistreat you and still hating you because you turn a man. This going to be hard but cut her ties and give distance because from the look from it she is toxic for you and she is affecting negatively. Do not expect to change anyone or save anyone unless they willing to do so . In order to help somebody  , said person need to be their own help first and take responsibility to their life. I know you love because she is your mom but if you consider her being to much to handle then try to take distance to her. But this is merely my opinion and suggestion. Is is your responsibility and your choice not mine.  You can ignore me if you want .	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f112038e2f73c3f0ff15b	00016b18b2--608f112038e2f73c3f0ff15b	APPROVED

"In her 2004 book ""undoing gender"", Butler did attempt to differentiate between violent incestuous pedophilia and good consensual incestuous pedophilia. She argued that sometimes parent-child incest is not violation of children's rights, but denying the child's agency to consent to such relationships is the real violation -- ""the reification of the child's body as passive surface would thus constitute, at a theatrical level, a further deprivation of the child: the deprivation of the psychic life...so I keep adding this qualification : 'when incest is a violation', suggesting that l think there may be occasions in which it is not.

I think you’re making a false equivalency here with the idea that the women you mentioned = the common way women are depicted. You’ve also named a number of awesome ladies, but Anakin and Obi-Wan, Luke and Han and Chewie, Max himself and all the boys on the road. And those are just in those movies you listed, not the majority of movies that don’t even have female main characters.The ones you named are good examples to base your writing on, but even better? The women in your life. You sister, mother, friends. Listen to them to understand what it’s like to be a woman and write more authentic characters.We aren’t a debate or cmv sub though, and this doesn’t add to feminist discourse so will be removed.

"The oppression of women is not because of the interests of little girls or the aesthetic tastes of young women.  For years, when I was on Facebook as a young mom, every Christmas there would be a TON of posts about STEM toys for little girls.  As if the fact that little girls liking dolls is the reason grown women are pushed out of leadership positions in STEM fields and face discrimination, harassment and toxic work environments.  Spoiler alert-the reason was men and misogyny.Telling women what they should and should not wear IS the problem.  Telling women what they can and cannot like IS the problem. Shaming women for wearing dresses or liking pink because they are ""brainwashed"" is NO DIFFERENT from telling women they need to have a ""bikini body"" or that their bra straps are too distracting for boys to see.Furthermore, ""masculine"" traits and interests ARE NOT BETTER IN ANY WAY than ""feminine"" traits and interests.  The ONLY reason you think that is because those traits were associated with masculinity/femininity in the first place.  Pink is not a worse color than blue.  Pants are not better clothing than skirts.  Having short hair is not better than long.  Pretty and sparkly and fluffy and cute are not somehow demeaning to like.  It is beyond shameful and gross to judge and shame women for their genuine interests."	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f11337a19413e31735ff7	00016b18b2--608f11337a19413e31735ff7	APPROVED

I think that the best way to help is simply to always be a good example with your behaviour and to point out misogynistic comments, even when they're subtle. Especially if you're a man, I cannot tell you how relieving it is to see men recognizing them and be able to call them out.The best advice I can give you is to listen to women. Listen and understand when they're frustrated and complaining about some misogynistic behaviour that bothered them. Then put that into practice and encourage your friends to do the same.If you really want to join something, it all comes down to where you live and what you do in life. If you're still in school, in most universities you'll find some kind of feminist group, you could start there. Otherwise you can look for associations who help women in some kind of way and volounteer or give them money. At least in my country, they often rely solely on money from the State, then I guess donations are really welcome.	1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f11337a19413e31735ff7	00016b18b2--608f11337a19413e31735ff7	APPROVED

it took so long to find a safe space on this app to post about this.my boyfriend is a great guy, we live together and everything’s been going great. by far the most respectful man i think i’ve ever met. though a while ago we got into an argument where he ended up saying something about how he completely understands feminism because he was raised by his mom after his parents got divorced as a kid, and he’s had many conversations with her about feminine topics. earlier in the argument he said something about how i could never fully understand something because i hadn’t lived it, so i got defensive and angry and said by that standard he couldn’t fully understand feminism. he in turn got angry and said i was devaluing his experience, and that he does understand. i’ve heard his friends be very disrespectful while talking about women and he never calls them out for it. he’s very quick to make judgements on women’s’ appearances while we’re watching a tv show or movie. i don’t think he’s done any research on the topic, he tries to avoid uncomfortable conversations about it, is dismissive of statistics, and i don’t think he’s acknowledged his internalized misogyny (that we all have), in fact i think he’s in denial of it. i don’t know how to have a conversation with him about it, let alone bring the topic up to him. i think he would get angry again. i don’t know, maybe i’m being nitpicky about this. and maybe i’m just making unfair assumptions. TL;DRboyfriend says he fully understands feminism but has done no research, and (i believe) is in denial of his internalized misogyny. idk how to talk to him about it. i’d love to hear someone’s thoughts and maybe just talk about it.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f1149e161907a44073f34	00016b18b2--608f1149e161907a44073f34	APPROVED

She was the one who originally got me into feminism and taught me comprehensive sex ed through her videos. I always found her takes informative, well researched, and easily accessible. Her content always felt inclusive, and I learned a lot about the trans community, non-binary community, and social issues through her. I remember in 2016, she started dating Chris Ray Gun and debated Blaire White. She still more or less held (and holds) the same POV in her videos, it’s just that she’s more interested in discussions and discourse. Is this why people hate her so much now? I’ve seen multiple articles take more recent videos out of context, and it seems to me that several people read those articles and made their decisions based off that?

You fucked up. Given the nature of harrassment, you can't make amends with the person you wronged without potentially aggravating the damage.  You've apologized to her. In the context of her, you're done.And the part of you that eats at you to wanting to make this better? Direct it towards your future actions. Forgive yourself so you don't feel like you're unforgivable because feeling unforgivable gives you permission to not try in the future.

I am someone who claimed to be a feminist( I believed and still Do, but thats not the point here). Last year, I sexually harassed someone, presuming consent while there was none. When she told me about it, I sent a blanket apology, after telling her that I did not intend to or did not know that I was harassing her. She came out in public about it a while ago, and I want to introspect and try and make amends. As someone who used to read up on Affirmative Consent, I know reading up is probably not the way forward.

Frankly, not much.   Sounds like another empty platitude - like “I’m with her!”  or  “girl power!”   I wouldn’t waste time seeking meaning in it. If you entertain it literally, it strikes me as erroneous or groundless anyway - what about the world’s future would one expect to be female (let’s assume that predicate means ‘created, controlled, or maintained by females’?—scientific advances? The great works of Art and literature? Commerce? International relations?  These are made possible by mostly males and always have been.  30+ years of blatant economic and educational affirmative action has led to the same old, “there’s still systemic sexism, men are too rude or too brash or don’t take women seriously enough when they talk or try to contribute.” These are supposedly obstacles holding women back from thriving—they’re being persecuted. Compare said behaviour to the rampant  antisemitism Freud faced at the university of Vienna, or the major campaign in Physics against the younger Einstein’s “Jewish Science”, or the Church physically threatening Galieo, locking him in his house for endorsing anti-scripture ideas emerging from his research.

I find no one wants to ever actually answer this question, as it leads down a path that invalidates many of the arguments and methods used to achieve equality (a term no one wants to define in detail as well). At the highest level we should all have equality. But when we break down all of the ways an individual can be defined (gender, ethnicity, income, social class, sexuality preference, attractiveness, geography, athleticism, and so on and so on) it becomes almost impossible. People then simplify it in the groups that benefit them and argue for that.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f117513b306608cf41a5f	00016b18b2--608f117513b306608cf41a5f	APPROVED

I think that the point is that violence exists, but the gender itself has no part in it.Someone of course can have a sexual orientation towards women and be a rapist.But someone could also be gay and rape a person of the same sex. this does not make it gender violence.

Personally, I think it can be feminist. But the distinction has as much to do with postmodernism as it does anything else.  Epstein bought a series of paintings by artist Maria Farmer depicting and exploring puberty. The paintings weren't intended to be erotic, but Jeffrey Epstein, whose predilections are now all public knowledge, projected a different set of values on her paintings.The same can be done in reverse.  Erotica can be reinterpreted and reclaimed as feminist empowerment.   Or not.  Depending on who you ask.  Art has as much about the relationship between the art and the viewer as it does the art and the artist.  It's your bicep.  Your canvas.  Your gaze.  Your art.  Your artist.  Your expression.  Express yourself in a way that empowers you.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f11814b93044d50634403	00016b18b2--608f11814b93044d50634403	APPROVED

Here again , I gotta tell you  what she did to you was disgusting  and worst she is throwing her to you which is not your responsability whatsoever. Also, your social skills can be  improved but you have to take away that self loathing and start respecting yourself and loving yourself without narcisism. I guess she is using as a emotional baggage to her vindictive  and hatred towards you. The question is how self aware is she that she is doing that to you? Do you ever talk to her about this ? Try to talk to her and be assertive ( no , I am not talking being agressive or screaming or anything of that . Rather that learn  to respect others while respecting yourselves.  This self hatred won't t let you improve as a person. It self sabotage you. The reason you are being bully is because you do not put boundaries ( I also struggle on that)  and people do not like pushovers and people who do not stand their ground due that is consider weakness. Worst this behavior atract toxic people into your life.  I suggest to go to a phsycology, find a hobby, read philosophy,  and reflect what life do want as person and create your own purpose.  In regard to your mother,  if she continues to mistreat you and still hating you because you turn a man. This going to be hard but cut her ties and give distance because from the look from it she is toxic for you and she is affecting negatively. Do not expect to change anyone or save anyone unless they willing to do so . In order to help somebody  , said person need to be their own help first and take responsibility to their life. I know you love because she is your mom but if you consider her being to much to handle then try to take distance to her. But this is merely my opinion and suggestion. Is is your responsibility and your choice not mine.

When I was fourteen the boy a few streets over developed a crush on me. I talked to him to be friendly but eventually got creeped out. He would ask to walk me to and from school, he showered me with gifts, would tell on me to my parents if I didn’t give him extra attention and would come over my house several times per day when I wasn’t home and just sit outside or interrogate my family on where I was. He messaged me from every social media and made new ones whenever I blocked him (this was after my dad had to call the phone company and have his number blocked so he would stop texting me). He started having my friends leave me monster energy drinks during the school day, which I didn’t even like. He even showed up at my moms work once to ask her how I was and she didn’t even know him! I started seeing him stand outside of my house in the street sometimes just sort of wandering around outside my window and that’s when I got suuuuuper creeped out. I went outside one day and told him I didn’t like him and I was not ever going to like him with how he was acting. Next thing I knew he hated me and told all of our mutual friends I was a slut. By the time junior year came around he was still salty about it and occasionally I’d hear rumors he had spread about me. Once or twice throughout junior/senior year he messaged me saying he was sorry and still liked me. I saw him wandering outside my house a few more times. He offered to buy me more monsters, which I of course didn’t want, and when I turned them down he would get so sad and say something like “well, maybe someday....”. Ugh still creeps me out.	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f119e82989918dad5956e	00016b18b2--608f119e82989918dad5956e	APPROVED

With your fresh point of view, you can sometime notice those, and in a few month, find solution to improve it. It might take time, because you have to learn a bit more about how things work at your new job to get the bigger picture. Keep those notes and read them even a year into the job, and you might have a brilliant idea.

I only recently started growing my collection, because we just bought and moved into our first house. My last place had no room.   So far I have 2 succulents named Stu and Larry.   I have a Japanese Boxwood that I probably pamper the most, and I've named her Baise (pronounce Bae-Zee).   I'm working on growing some avocado trees, they're only just starting to sprout, and so far I've only named one of them (Lennon).

I have two brothers and they were both ushers at my wedding. After they seated the guests and the wedding party made their entrance, my brothers simply walked me down the aisle too. I do remember I had to adamantly repeat to our elderly male officiant that I wanted to completely omit the “who gives this woman” bit and he really didn’t seem to understand why. No matter how many times I explained it, he just kept trying to reword it and force us to do it.

"The oppression of women is not because of the interests of little girls or the aesthetic tastes of young women.  For years, when I was on Facebook as a young mom, every Christmas there would be a TON of posts about STEM toys for little girls.  As if the fact that little girls liking dolls is the reason grown women are pushed out of leadership positions in STEM fields and face discrimination, harassment and toxic work environments.  Spoiler alert-the reason was men and misogyny.Telling women what they should and should not wear IS the problem.  Telling women what they can and cannot like IS the problem. Shaming women for wearing dresses or liking pink because they are ""brainwashed"" is NO DIFFERENT from telling women they need to have a ""bikini body"" or that their bra straps are too distracting for boys to see.Furthermore, ""masculine"" traits and interests ARE NOT BETTER IN ANY WAY than ""feminine"" traits and interests.  The ONLY reason you think that is because those traits were associated with masculinity/femininity in the first place.  Pink is not a worse color than blue.  Pants are not better clothing than skirts.  Having short hair is not better than long.  Pretty and sparkly and fluffy and cute are not somehow demeaning to like.  It is beyond shameful and gross to judge and shame women for their genuine interests."	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f11e0edc8e237c0d26b88	00016b18b2--608f11e0edc8e237c0d26b88	APPROVED

I think that the best way to help is simply to always be a good example with your behaviour and to point out misogynistic comments, even when they're subtle. Especially if you're a man, I cannot tell you how relieving it is to see men recognizing them and be able to call them out.The best advice I can give you is to listen to women. Listen and understand when they're frustrated and complaining about some misogynistic behaviour that bothered them. Then put that into practice and encourage your friends to do the same.If you really want to join something, it all comes down to where you live and what you do in life. If you're still in school, in most universities you'll find some kind of feminist group, you could start there. Otherwise you can look for associations who help women in some kind of way and volounteer or give them money. At least in my country, they often rely solely on money from the State, then I guess donations are really welcome.	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f11e0edc8e237c0d26b88	00016b18b2--608f11e0edc8e237c0d26b88	APPROVED

I don’t think I ever truly “gotten over” it. Because some days I still get sad about it. And that’s okay.

I started later than people, but I’m not behind because I’m on my own path, and they are on their own.

>A decent part of feminism is teaching women to become better women. Break this tradition. Go to college. Do this thing, don't do that thing. Ect.lol.  It teaches them to become sexless worker bots, man hating, yes - but even more so femininity hating.    These are not 'better women' they are the casualties of feminism,  they plan to have families after menopause,  they will never have families,  they will die alone.     No one is AS alone as an old feminist woman,  or as bitter.

Here again , I gotta tell you  what she did to you was disgusting  and worst she is throwing her to you which is not your responsability whatsoever. Also, your social skills can be  improved but you have to take away that self loathing and start respecting yourself and loving yourself without narcisism. I guess she is using as a emotional baggage to her vindictive  and hatred towards you. The question is how self aware is she that she is doing that to you? Do you ever talk to her about this ? Try to talk to her and be assertive ( no , I am not talking being agressive or screaming or anything of that . Rather that learn  to respect others while respecting yourselves.  This self hatred won't t let you improve as a person. It self sabotage you. The reason you are being bully is because you do not put boundaries ( I also struggle on that)  and people do not like pushovers and people who do not stand their ground due that is consider weakness. Worst this behavior atract toxic people into your life.  I suggest to go to a phsycology, find a hobby, read philosophy,  and reflect what life do want as person and create your own purpose.  In regard to your mother,  if she continues to mistreat you and still hating you because you turn a man. This going to be hard but cut her ties and give distance because from the look from it she is toxic for you and she is affecting negatively. Do not expect to change anyone or save anyone unless they willing to do so . In order to help somebody  , said person need to be their own help first and take responsibility to their life. I know you love because she is your mom but if you consider her being to much to handle then try to take distance to her. But this is merely my opinion and suggestion. Is is your responsibility and your choice not mine.

Hi. I guess i was just a little curious. I used to be a waitress in a small diner and to be kind to customers id call them sweetie or darling or deary or hon.

So? What is your point? Feminism is about equality, not about WoMeN aRe BetTeR thAn MeN.

I (28f) lost my brother (32) two years ago. It was a tragic work accident. At first the thoughts were haunting, and I didn’t think I would ever be able to stop hurting. I still don’t, but the pain has faded. It’s like your heart has been torn open, but as time goes on it begins to scar and fade. However, you know the pain is still there. Losing a sibling is a tough grief to overcome. You loved each other, hated each other, you grew together, there was envy and silliness. Laughs and tears. I feel like it’s one of the more honest relationship we have throughout our lives. You’re going to hurt, and that’s okay. But never forget to stop and laugh at the good memories too. I’ve learned to take them one at a time, and hope for the best. I’m sorry for your loss.

Although there's no draft, here's how it negatively affected me:I had to sign up for the draft the first year it was re-introduced, in 1980. I very grudgingly did so.Thirty years later, in 2010, my employer announced they would be closing my local office soon. About the same time the IRS announced they would be hiring soon for jobs for the following tax season. I applied, got called to in to take an aptitude test, and was interviewed. I was told that they really liked me, bit I needed evidence that I registered for the draft, and gave me the online address to ask for it. So I did.A few days later I got a call from Selective Service asking why I needed this. Apparently everything went online about 15 or 20 years before, but the older stuff was warehoused off-site. When I said it was for the IRS, they said something like, oh, yeah, they don't mess around. We'll send out to the warehouse and verify so we can send the document you need.Long story short, it took about a week for this to happen, and in the meantime all the positions they were hiring for were filled, mostly by women, who weren't held to the same standard. The people I interviewed with apologized and said they'd probably be hiring again in a year and I should apply again then.So, I missed out on a job opportunity because I had to jump through a hoop that many of the other applicants didn't, and the hoop was even higher for me due to my age.	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f133c0b14ef5c4fc849ba	00016b18b2--608f133c0b14ef5c4fc849ba	APPROVED

"You're not railing against women? InterestingOK. Let's look at your post history (and let's not even delve into the comment history). - how dare feminists say my not crying is TOXIC!- why can't feminists accept men as they are! How dare they call us toxic. X2- feminists are making male suicide a competition!- toxic femininity! Women always have to be the victim!!- Saying ""toxic masculinity"" is derogatory!!- APA is sexist against men for pointing out detrimental behaviours and outcomes!- women are more cooperative during conflicts with attractive men.- complaining about a post being removed on askfeminists- men are sexually assaulted as much as women! If you can't see that you seem hyperfocussed on women, and the fact that they dare to advocate.for women's issues, or suggest that some typical, old-school behaviours are HARMFUL to the men displaying them... while at the same time defending to the death those same toxic traits that likely contribute to your own mental health struggles. In one reply you say to me that your suicidal ideation is the result of feeling upset about *your mother* and how she is stuck in a home, about witnessing her rape and beatings... and then you get sarcastic and aggressive when its suggested you get some healing and closure by advocating against domestic violence, because HOW DARE one suggest you only focus on what happened to my mother.

When I was younger, I was actively anorexic for several years. I think the world at large has gotten better about recognizing that eating disorders are not (wholly) about appearance, that every person has their own reasons behind their eating disorder.The thing that annoys me about the portrayal of anorexia is that it doesn’t seem to get any attention until the affected person is deathly thin. Eating disorders have a lot of bad health consequences, and short of dying of starvation, you don’t have to be shockingly underweight to suffer those consequences. When I was younger I was also diagnosed with bipolar II, though recently that diagnosis has changed to generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and depression. My own emotional immaturity, not understanding my own emotions, and the interplay of the two disorders probably contributed to the diagnosis of BPII and many years of heavy medication. So that’s another thing people don’t always know: these diagnosis typically aren’t set in stone, particularly if you were diagnosed fairly young, as I was. As far as daily life, I cannot recall a time where I was not anxious. Even  my earliest memories are tinged with anxiety. I’ve had suicidal thoughts on and off since I was an adolescent. As a result my view of “normal” is skewed. My anxiety is probably around a 5-6 on a low anxiety day (like on vacation, or a lazy Saturday). It’s not until I get to a 7+ that I start to notice it. I’m scoring on a 1-10 scale where 1 is no anxiety, 10 is pure out-of-the-blue panic attack.  If I’m below a 4, it feels weird. It feels like something is wrong. The easiest way to describe how my anxiety typically looks is to give an example. Most recently it was my covid vaccine. Initially planned on getting it as soon as I was eligible. Then I had people around me starting to pressure me to get it before I was eligible. When I feel that kind of pressure, I push back. I avoid. So then I decided I wasn’t getting it. Then I started obsessing. The anxiety got so bad on a daily basis that I broke, and on first day of eligibility I signed up, with the caveat that if I couldn’t get an appointment that week, and my fiancé wasn’t allowed to stay with me during the shot, I wasn’t going to do it. My conditions were met, still about had a panic attack getting the shot (I hadn’t had any shot for 20+ years).  But I got through it, and got my second one last week. None of my hesitancy was about the safety or efficacy of the shot. I don’t think there are microchips or I’m going to turn into a zombie.  It’s about feeling like I am able to make my own decisions without outside pressure.So that’s usually how it manifests. Have plan, feel backed into a corner I don’t want to be in, resist, obsess, then break as long as I can still feel like the driver of my own life. If I can’t, I double down.(If you know someone like me, the best advice I can give is back off. Let them know you’re available to talk if they want, but don’t try and force talk. If they do talk to you, try to be factual while a) acknowledging they are having anxiety and b) withholding judgement as much as you can.)	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f13488342200cc3f31303	00016b18b2--608f13488342200cc3f31303	APPROVED
Better public transit.

me. god me. i was friends with this girl for years. we met because she was the best friend of the girl my ex cheated on me with. their friendship fell apart and eventually we started talking. and that fell into us hanging out all the time and being on facetime all the time since we were both homeschooled. and for some insight she is the type to literally never be single. i think the entire time we were friends she was single for a week all together. and she always liked douchy guys that always tried to hit on me when she wasn't around. or try talking/making plans with me and not involving her. which i never reciprocated because gross. and i would always try to confront her with the evidence and she would then confront them. and they always have some sob story and she believed them over me, every damn time. and they would turn against me and make her turn against me. and she always dropped me for them like clock work. went from hanging out and talking everyday to basically nothing. one of them ended up in the hospital and made her chose me or them. and she sent me screenshots saying she chose them. and then had the audacity to say it was fine and we would still talk. god it broke my heart. and then a couple weeks or months went by and she would come crawling back. and we were stuck in this stupid cycle for years. and i finally put my foot down and blew up on her about how bad of a friend she was. and she proceeded to blow up my phone while i was at work and leave threatening voice mails. and even showed up at my workplace multiple times but always on my days off. it was horrible. and i would never wish it on anyone. so been there! it gets better i promise.	1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f13a08342200cc3f31757	00016b18b2--608f13a08342200cc3f31757	APPROVED

"There's a lot of Western bias in this perspective.  I'll copy-paste a comment that I just left in another thread:Circumcision only causes no harm if you assume the foreskin and its functions have no value to its owner, which you simply cannot do on behalf of all men.  I could also justify routine double mastectomies, which would eliminate breast cancer and save half a million lives every year, if I disregard the value that breasts have to women.Regarding putting FGM in another category...again, that's cultural bias talking.Type IV FGM, which is performed in Indonesia and is the most common form of FGM worldwide, removes nothing from the girl's body.  [A study found](https://knowledgecommons.popcouncil.org/departments_sbsr-rh/34/) that 92% of Indonesian mothers support the practice, and only 2% say it isn't beneficial.  In Egypt, where the forms of FGM are more severe (Type I), [82% of women support continuing the practice](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3134892/), with a majority responding that it doesn't lessen sexual pleasure.  In Africa, [an anti-FGM task force](https://www.taskforcefgm.de/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/hast81.pdf) claims that in cultures that cut women:1. *""Research by gynecologists and others has demonstrated that a high percentage of women who have had genital surgery have rich sexual lives, including desire, arousal, orgasm, and satisfaction, and their frequency of sexual activity is not reduced.""*  - *""Many women who have had genital surgeries view the procedure as a cosmetic beautification, moral enhancement, or dignifying improvement of the appearance of the human body. This is true of both male and female genital modifications in African cultures.*""2. *""The widely publicized and sensationalized reproductive health and medical complications associated with female genital surgeries in Africa are infrequent events and represent the exception rather than the rule.""*3. *""Female genital surgeries in Africa are viewed by many insiders as aesthetic enhancements of the body and are not judged to be 'mutilations.'""*4. *""Female genital surgery in Africa is typically controlled and managed by women. Similarly, male genital surgery is usually controlled and managed by men. Although both men and women play roles in perpetuating and supporting the genital modification customs of their cultures, female genital surgery should not be blamed on men or on patriarchy.""*5. *""Demographic and health survey data reveal that when compared with men, an equal or higher proportion of women favor the continuation of female genital surgeries.""*The truth is, in cultures that cut girls, FGM is justified in a myriad of ways, often by the women in those cultures. There are also some health benefits:http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1113&context=iph_theseshttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/265824402_Female_Circumcision_and_HIV_Infection_in_Tanzania_for_Better_or_for_Worsehttps://www.jsm.jsexmed.org/article/S1743-6095(18)31387-0/abstractWe could justify FGM fairly easily. All we have to do is disregard a woman's right to bodily autonomy, and ignore the value a woman might place on these body parts.Likewise, for male circumcision, there are absolutely still people who still practice it to this day in an effort to curb sexual pleasure.  I've saved a list of quotes from Jewish leaders, since that hits particularly close to home for me:* [Chabad](https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1014930/jewish/The-Mitzvah-of-Circumcision-Part-I.htm) (Major Jewish organization)> It weakens sexual desire and pleasure, hopefully giving a person more  strength to restrain himself from engaging in forbidden sexual  encounters. In a similar vein, Nachmanides writes that the *brit* reminds us to only use the male organ in a permissible and positive way.* [Rabbi Jonathan Sacks](http://rabbisacks.org/the-eighth-day/) (UK chief rabbi)> Circumcision symbolises the idea that there is something higher than nature. Passing on our genes to the next generation should not simply be a blind instinct, a Darwinian drive. The Abrahamic covenant was based on sexual fidelity, the sanctity of marriage, and the consecration of the love that brings new life into the world.* [Ritual Well](https://ritualwell.org/ritual/blood-and-men) (Canadian Reform rabbi)> Circumcision functions not only as ritual initiation but also as the communal ritual setting of boundaries to male sexuality. At the brit milah male blood is the metaphor for discipline and control over the ultimate male lack of control: unbounded and dangerous sexuality.* Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan (from link above)> The covenant of circumcision was one of the things that elevated Abraham and his children from the fallen state resulting from the expulsion from Eden. As a result of this covenant, the sexual act of the Jew enters the realm of the holy, and partakes of man's optimum state before his expulsion.* [Jewish Agency](http://archive.jewishagency.org/nechama-leibowitz/content/23929) (largest Jewish organisation)> Accordingly, this precept fulfills an educational and disciplinary role in the relationship of man towards his Creator. It harbors a permanent warning against the sinful use of the organ of reproduction: it elevates carnal activity to the level of a mitzvah… (The article then goes on to approvingly cite Maimonides and others who praised sexually repression by circumcision)* [Times of Israel](https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/brit-milah-pinchas-and-cyprus/)> ...his reproductive organ is not simply going to be used for pleasure or Darwinian reproduction. Instead, it will be used to continue the divine relationship from gen...eration to generation. When we mark our 8-day-old sons’ male reproductive organs, we are passing them the obligation to use their reproductive will in the service of the divine relationship. We are instructing them, almost from birth, that they are responsible for the proper use of their reproductive will.* [Commentary magazine](https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/the-new-enemies-of-circumcision/)> Where much of contemporary American culture now places the highest valuation on pleasure, especially sexual pleasure, and on the avoidance of any sort of pain, the classical Jewish texts value the willingness to suffer for a worthy cause, speak of the sanctity of marriage, and elevate self-control over self-expression.* [Aish ha-Torah](https://www.aish.com/jl/l/b/What_is_Circumcision.html)> In addition, *Brit Milah* is done specifically on the site that is identified with our greatest physical desires, thus empowering us to rise above the demands of our bodies.* [Reform Judaism website](https://reformjudaism.org/learning/torah-study/lech-lcha/brit-milah-jewish-answer-modernity)> Judaism, on the other hand, is in many ways a rebellion against nature. Yes, we are told to care for the natural world, but we are also told to work hard to make it better―to repair it. \[...\]And that's why religion tries to control nature. Judaism teaches that the world as God gave it to us isn't good enough―we need to perfect it. Nature makes illness; we must find cures. Nature wired us with all kinds of base desires; we must control them. In nature, most of God's creatures behave like animals; we must be better.* [Moshe Friedman](http://nymohel.com/laws_customs.php), NY mohel> By physically removing the foreskin, we are spiritually removing and eliminating undesirable character traits, depressive tendencies and so on. We eliminate from the body of the child, forces which might try to cultivate overindulgence in physical pleasures, etc.Few other links: [1](https://embassies.gov.il/holysee/Relations/Pages/Corporeality.aspx), [2](http://www.jtsa.edu/the-mitzvah-of-circumcision), [3](https://www.vosla.org/brit-milah-naming), [4](https://torahclass.com/archived-articles/835-jewish-identity-and-the-torah-part-1-by-rabbi-baruch), [5](https://www.dallasobserver.com/news/prime-cut-6401547), [6](https://www.orthodox-jews.com/what-is-a-bris.html), [7](http://www.britpro.com/default.asp?p=bris), [8](https://www.brismilah.org/press/prime-cut-dallas-observer/)We've created a false dichotomy in the west based on comparing the most extreme consequences of FGM with the most palatable excuses for MGM.  In reality, FGM encompasses a broad spectrum of practices, for a variety of reasons and with a variety of outcomes, and much of the justification we apply to male circumcision is echoed by FGM proponents.To respond to some of your specific points:> most male circumcisions are done in hospitals or sterile environment with clean medical cutting tools, while most female genital mutilations are done out in the open with dirty non-medical cutting toolsWhy does the setting matter?  If a girl were circumcised in a hospital, would that suddenly be okay?  (Edit: according to UNICEF, [one in four FGM procedures were performed by a healthcare provider](https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/approximately-1-4-fgm-survivors-were-cut-health-care-provider).)Also, every country that cuts girls with ""dirty tools"" also cuts boys.> the equivalent to removing the foreskin in females would be the clitoral hoodThis is form Type Ia of FGM:https://www.who.int/teams/sexual-and-reproductive-health-and-research/key-areas-of-work/female-genital-mutilation/types-of-female-genital-mutilationAre you okay with removing a baby girl's clitoral hood if it's done in a hospital setting?"	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f1403dce1aa1bd00a2f43	00016b18b2--608f1403dce1aa1bd00a2f43	APPROVED

Personally, I think it can be feminist. But the distinction has as much to do with postmodernism as it does anything else.  Epstein bought a series of paintings by artist Maria Farmer depicting and exploring puberty. The paintings weren't intended to be erotic, but Jeffrey Epstein, whose predilections are now all public knowledge, projected a different set of values on her paintings.The same can be done in reverse.  Erotica can be reinterpreted and reclaimed as feminist empowerment.   Or not.  Depending on who you ask.  Art has as much about the relationship between the art and the viewer as it does the art and the artist.  It's your bicep.  Your canvas.  Your gaze.  Your art.  Your artist.  Your expression.  Express yourself in a way that empowers you.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f14c07a19413e317387b0	00016b18b2--608f14c07a19413e317387b0	APPROVED

Pakistani Americans are so different then the ones here in the UK. If that was in the UK and the girls were going to get away with it there would be riots in cities like Bradford & Birmingham. It seems like Pakistani Americans are like the quite and peaceful minority trying to make a living meanwhile being victims of black crime doesn't register with the woke clowns. I would imagine if the girls were white or worse white men there would have been a massive uproar in the media about how evil white people are. Why does the media ignore Black crime on other races?

it took so long to find a safe space on this app to post about this.my boyfriend is a great guy, we live together and everything’s been going great. by far the most respectful man i think i’ve ever met. though a while ago we got into an argument where he ended up saying something about how he completely understands feminism because he was raised by his mom after his parents got divorced as a kid, and he’s had many conversations with her about feminine topics. earlier in the argument he said something about how i could never fully understand something because i hadn’t lived it, so i got defensive and angry and said by that standard he couldn’t fully understand feminism. he in turn got angry and said i was devaluing his experience, and that he does understand. i’ve heard his friends be very disrespectful while talking about women and he never calls them out for it. he’s very quick to make judgements on women’s’ appearances while we’re watching a tv show or movie. i don’t think he’s done any research on the topic, he tries to avoid uncomfortable conversations about it, is dismissive of statistics, and i don’t think he’s acknowledged his internalized misogyny (that we all have), in fact i think he’s in denial of it. i don’t know how to have a conversation with him about it, let alone bring the topic up to him. i think he would get angry again. i don’t know, maybe i’m being nitpicky about this. and maybe i’m just making unfair assumptions. TL;DRboyfriend says he fully understands feminism but has done no research, and (i believe) is in denial of his internalized misogyny. idk how to talk to him about it. i’d love to hear someone’s thoughts and maybe just talk about it.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f17384b93044d50638cec	00016b18b2--608f17384b93044d50638cec	APPROVED

She was the one who originally got me into feminism and taught me comprehensive sex ed through her videos. I always found her takes informative, well researched, and easily accessible. Her content always felt inclusive, and I learned a lot about the trans community, non-binary community, and social issues through her. I remember in 2016, she started dating Chris Ray Gun and debated Blaire White. She still more or less held (and holds) the same POV in her videos, it’s just that she’s more interested in discussions and discourse. Is this why people hate her so much now? I’ve seen multiple articles take more recent videos out of context, and it seems to me that several people read those articles and made their decisions based off that? I brought her up in feminist twitter, and people started talking about how Laci “went down a horrible path”...am I missing something? Did she do anything worse than what I have observed?	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f17384b93044d50638cec	00016b18b2--608f17384b93044d50638cec	APPROVED

I (28f) lost my brother (32) two years ago. It was a tragic work accident. At first the thoughts were haunting, and I didn’t think I would ever be able to stop hurting. I still don’t, but the pain has faded. It’s like your heart has been torn open, but as time goes on it begins to scar and fade. However, you know the pain is still there. Losing a sibling is a tough grief to overcome. You loved each other, hated each other, you grew together, there was envy and silliness. Laughs and tears. I feel like it’s one of the more honest relationship we have throughout our lives. You’re going to hurt, and that’s okay. But never forget to stop and laugh at the good memories too.

"Ask in some of the ""no politics here"" witch subs here and witch groups on Facebook, and  you will get a very different answer, in part because of the whole ""colonize spirituality"" thing that a lot of white women (and many white men) get into. They often don't realize they're extending their imperialist worldview to their faith/practice (or, indeed, that they *have* an imperialist worldview)—they call it cutesy bullshit like ""I'm an *eclectic* witch, teehee!"" while their practice willfully and knowingly stomps on POC and other minority groups. (Before anyone gets upset: **Full respect** to *real* eclectic witches who have done their homework and are not willfully causing harm with their practices. **I'm not calling y'all out.** I'm calling out Becky WhitePerson and her ""I don't care if it hurts Native feelings when I use sage, feathers, and abalone—it's *my* practice and I'll hurt everyone I want!"" mindset.)Being a witch is inherently political. Most of us chose to follow this calling, and choosing to be a witch is choosing to side with marginalized people and spirits—and choosing to marginalize yourself in many ways. How can you, as a marginalized person, stand by or actively support a political force that causes harm to marginalized people? The boot right-wingers lick will eventually step on whyte supremacist ""witches"" as much as it steps on everyone else—and your support won't save you…or at least, it won't while letting you keep your Craft alive.

Tarot decks are one thing for focus, but you don't need them. All they began as were European playing cards. They are still just European playing cards in many cases. I saw my first tarot that way, being used by my Spanish grandfather and his friends.Before the 1960s, late, all card reading was done with poker decks. Look for older books to tell you what stood for what. It's the reader, not the cards, doing the work. (Even if collecting decks is one of my weak points. Love the art.)For that matter, I've designed two decks. They are my faves. Get a source on what they're supposed to mean, and make cards with a symbolism that works for you, that you can remember. Can't make pictures? Composite symbols in graphics programs or with old-school collage. Redesign them as you understand more.

I was listening to an excellent podcast where they talked about how the division of labour has ended up this way, and for the most part it’s that technology which was designed to make stuff easier only removed the labour for menE.g.: - electric and gas stove = no need for men to chop wood and build a fire- washing machine = no need for men to bring water from the wellWhile both these devices do make the rest of the job somewhat easier, the bulk of the work to be done even with this tech is still traditionally “women’s” work. Meaning, men created devices to do “their share” of the labour without any thought to reducing the work for women.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f1fc2dce1aa1bd00a9c4d	00016b18b2--608f1fc2dce1aa1bd00a9c4d	APPROVED
The people that can get pregnant are the ones that absolutely need to be able to control conception.  Pregnancy is serious enough that it should never be accidental.If you want to argue based on largest consequences though, I think you also come to the opposite conclusion.  Birth control isn't going to be 100% effective.  If it fails for that one man (or he sabotages it or declines it), that's 2430 pregnancies.   If it fails for one woman, that's one pregnancy.Yes, basic fairness is why men should absolutely have part of the birth control burden, but I don't think this is a great argument for it.	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f1fc2dce1aa1bd00a9c4d	00016b18b2--608f1fc2dce1aa1bd00a9c4d	APPROVED
Hello friends. As I was sitting in my chair this evening, I was remembering a WoNdErFuL conversation that I had with my mother yesterday. She has parties at our house every Sunday, and I was wearing a off the shoulder, sleeveless dress. And personally, I think that shaving my armpits is an ultimate waste of time. I like mine hairy. I have a bleeding disorder where my blood doesn’t clot and I always bleed out when shaving my pits. I’m also a busy young women who doesn’t have time to submit to the social standard that body hair isn’t natural for women, while men can do whatever they want with theirs. I’m also not a fan of deodorant, but wash my armpits in the shower to stop bacteria from growing. So, I was stretching as one does, and my mom goes “um.. Remley you need to stop moving your arms” and I was like “uhm... why?” And she was like “take a look at your armpits honey” so naturally I was like “uhm. Yeah. I have body hair. So does dad. And my brother. And you before you shaved yours off” and she grabbed my arm and put it down so that my baby armpit hairs couldn’t be seen. I’m kinda sad bc I luv mah buhbe armpit hairs ❤️ I’m also kinda scared bc I want to keep pads on top of my toilet for people when they come over to my house on Friday’s (my brother leads a Bible study at my house. I organize everything tho). Any tips on how to help her see that I’m allowed to have body hair, and help my friends to not be embarrassed if they need pads at my house?	1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f1fc2dce1aa1bd00a9c4d	00016b18b2--608f1fc2dce1aa1bd00a9c4d	APPROVED

"There's a lot of Western bias in this perspective.  I'll copy-paste a comment that I just left in another thread:Circumcision only causes no harm if you assume the foreskin and its functions have no value to its owner, which you simply cannot do on behalf of all men.  I could also justify routine double mastectomies, which would eliminate breast cancer and save half a million lives every year, if I disregard the value that breasts have to women.Regarding putting FGM in another category...again, that's cultural bias talking.Type IV FGM, which is performed in Indonesia and is the most common form of FGM worldwide, removes nothing from the girl's body.  [A study found](https://knowledgecommons.popcouncil.org/departments_sbsr-rh/34/) that 92% of Indonesian mothers support the practice, and only 2% say it isn't beneficial.  In Egypt, where the forms of FGM are more severe (Type I), [82% of women support continuing the practice](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3134892/), with a majority responding that it doesn't lessen sexual pleasure.  In Africa, [an anti-FGM task force](https://www.taskforcefgm.de/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/hast81.pdf) claims that in cultures that cut women:1. *""Research by gynecologists and others has demonstrated that a high percentage of women who have had genital surgery have rich sexual lives, including desire, arousal, orgasm, and satisfaction, and their frequency of sexual activity is not reduced.""*  - *""Many women who have had genital surgeries view the procedure as a cosmetic beautification, moral enhancement, or dignifying improvement of the appearance of the human body. This is true of both male and female genital modifications in African cultures.*""2. *""The widely publicized and sensationalized reproductive health and medical complications associated with female genital surgeries in Africa are infrequent events and represent the exception rather than the rule.""*3. *""Female genital surgeries in Africa are viewed by many insiders as aesthetic enhancements of the body and are not judged to be 'mutilations.'""*4. *""Female genital surgery in Africa is typically controlled and managed by women. Similarly, male genital surgery is usually controlled and managed by men. Although both men and women play roles in perpetuating and supporting the genital modification customs of their cultures, female genital surgery should not be blamed on men or on patriarchy.""*5. *""Demographic and health survey data reveal that when compared with men, an equal or higher proportion of women favor the continuation of female genital surgeries.""*The truth is, in cultures that cut girls, FGM is justified in a myriad of ways, often by the women in those cultures. There are also some health benefits:http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1113&context=iph_theseshttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/265824402_Female_Circumcision_and_HIV_Infection_in_Tanzania_for_Better_or_for_Worsehttps://www.jsm.jsexmed.org/article/S1743-6095(18)31387-0/abstractWe could justify FGM fairly easily. All we have to do is disregard a woman's right to bodily autonomy, and ignore the value a woman might place on these body parts.Likewise, for male circumcision, there are absolutely still people who still practice it to this day in an effort to curb sexual pleasure.  I've saved a list of quotes from Jewish leaders, since that hits particularly close to home for me:* [Chabad](https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1014930/jewish/The-Mitzvah-of-Circumcision-Part-I.htm) (Major Jewish organization)> It weakens sexual desire and pleasure, hopefully giving a person more  strength to restrain himself from engaging in forbidden sexual  encounters. In a similar vein, Nachmanides writes that the *brit* reminds us to only use the male organ in a permissible and positive way.* [Rabbi Jonathan Sacks](http://rabbisacks.org/the-eighth-day/) (UK chief rabbi)> Circumcision symbolises the idea that there is something higher than nature. Passing on our genes to the next generation should not simply be a blind instinct, a Darwinian drive. The Abrahamic covenant was based on sexual fidelity, the sanctity of marriage, and the consecration of the love that brings new life into the world.* [Ritual Well](https://ritualwell.org/ritual/blood-and-men) (Canadian Reform rabbi)> Circumcision functions not only as ritual initiation but also as the communal ritual setting of boundaries to male sexuality. At the brit milah male blood is the metaphor for discipline and control over the ultimate male lack of control: unbounded and dangerous sexuality.* Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan (from link above)> The covenant of circumcision was one of the things that elevated Abraham and his children from the fallen state resulting from the expulsion from Eden. As a result of this covenant, the sexual act of the Jew enters the realm of the holy, and partakes of man's optimum state before his expulsion.* [Jewish Agency](http://archive.jewishagency.org/nechama-leibowitz/content/23929) (largest Jewish organisation)> Accordingly, this precept fulfills an educational and disciplinary role in the relationship of man towards his Creator. It harbors a permanent warning against the sinful use of the organ of reproduction: it elevates carnal activity to the level of a mitzvah… (The article then goes on to approvingly cite Maimonides and others who praised sexually repression by circumcision)* [Times of Israel](https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/brit-milah-pinchas-and-cyprus/)> ...his reproductive organ is not simply going to be used for pleasure or Darwinian reproduction. Instead, it will be used to continue the divine relationship from gen...eration to generation. When we mark our 8-day-old sons’ male reproductive organs, we are passing them the obligation to use their reproductive will in the service of the divine relationship. We are instructing them, almost from birth, that they are responsible for the proper use of their reproductive will.* [Commentary magazine](https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/the-new-enemies-of-circumcision/)> Where much of contemporary American culture now places the highest valuation on pleasure, especially sexual pleasure, and on the avoidance of any sort of pain, the classical Jewish texts value the willingness to suffer for a worthy cause, speak of the sanctity of marriage, and elevate self-control over self-expression.* [Aish ha-Torah](https://www.aish.com/jl/l/b/What_is_Circumcision.html)> In addition, *Brit Milah* is done specifically on the site that is identified with our greatest physical desires, thus empowering us to rise above the demands of our bodies.* [Reform Judaism website](https://reformjudaism.org/learning/torah-study/lech-lcha/brit-milah-jewish-answer-modernity)> Judaism, on the other hand, is in many ways a rebellion against nature. Yes, we are told to care for the natural world, but we are also told to work hard to make it better―to repair it. \[...\]And that's why religion tries to control nature. Judaism teaches that the world as God gave it to us isn't good enough―we need to perfect it. Nature makes illness; we must find cures. Nature wired us with all kinds of base desires; we must control them. In nature, most of God's creatures behave like animals; we must be better.* [Moshe Friedman](http://nymohel.com/laws_customs.php), NY mohel> By physically removing the foreskin, we are spiritually removing and eliminating undesirable character traits, depressive tendencies and so on. We eliminate from the body of the child, forces which might try to cultivate overindulgence in physical pleasures, etc.Few other links: [1](https://embassies.gov.il/holysee/Relations/Pages/Corporeality.aspx), [2](http://www.jtsa.edu/the-mitzvah-of-circumcision), [3](https://www.vosla.org/brit-milah-naming), [4](https://torahclass.com/archived-articles/835-jewish-identity-and-the-torah-part-1-by-rabbi-baruch), [5](https://www.dallasobserver.com/news/prime-cut-6401547), [6](https://www.orthodox-jews.com/what-is-a-bris.html), [7](http://www.britpro.com/default.asp?p=bris), [8](https://www.brismilah.org/press/prime-cut-dallas-observer/)We've created a false dichotomy in the west based on comparing the most extreme consequences of FGM with the most palatable excuses for MGM.  In reality, FGM encompasses a broad spectrum of practices, for a variety of reasons and with a variety of outcomes, and much of the justification we apply to male circumcision is echoed by FGM proponents.To respond to some of your specific points:> most male circumcisions are done in hospitals or sterile environment with clean medical cutting tools, while most female genital mutilations are done out in the open with dirty non-medical cutting toolsWhy does the setting matter?  If a girl were circumcised in a hospital, would that suddenly be okay?  (Edit: according to UNICEF, [one in four FGM procedures were performed by a healthcare provider](https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/approximately-1-4-fgm-survivors-were-cut-health-care-provider).)Also, every country that cuts girls with ""dirty tools"" also cuts boys.> the equivalent to removing the foreskin in females would be the clitoral hoodThis is form Type Ia of FGM:https://www.who.int/teams/sexual-and-reproductive-health-and-research/key-areas-of-work/female-genital-mutilation/types-of-female-genital-mutilationAre you okay with removing a baby girl's clitoral hood if it's done in a hospital setting?"	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f1fdc6efd841d656ab019	00016b18b2--608f1fdc6efd841d656ab019	APPROVED

I think that the point is that violence exists, but the gender itself has no part in it.Someone of course can have a sexual orientation towards women and be a rapist.But someone could also be gay and rape a person of the same sex. this does not make it gender violence.

It’s funny because everything but the infanticide sounds pretty okay? Granted, I think he’s doing the fun republican thing where they pretend a clump of cells is a ‘child’, so even then it’s an issue of bodily autonomy not actual infanticide.	1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f1ff34b93044d5064292d	00016b18b2--608f1ff34b93044d5064292d	APPROVED
Personally, I think it can be feminist. But the distinction has as much to do with postmodernism as it does anything else.  Epstein bought a series of paintings by artist Maria Farmer depicting and exploring puberty. The paintings weren't intended to be erotic, but Jeffrey Epstein, whose predilections are now all public knowledge, projected a different set of values on her paintings.The same can be done in reverse.  Erotica can be reinterpreted and reclaimed as feminist empowerment.   Or not.  Depending on who you ask.  Art has as much about the relationship between the art and the viewer as it does the art and the artist.  It's your bicep.  Your canvas.  Your gaze.  Your art.  Your artist.  Your expression.  Express yourself in a way that empowers you.	1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f1ff34b93044d5064292d	00016b18b2--608f1ff34b93044d5064292d	APPROVED
My mother had the same issue herself. It only stopped once she got into her late thirties and ppl didn't assume that she might want another child. Being a woman is one of the most depressing things in the world and I honestly have no idea what advice to give you bc there is no real way to report this or get legal protection against discrimination.	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f1ff34b93044d5064292d	00016b18b2--608f1ff34b93044d5064292d	APPROVED

I find no one wants to ever actually answer this question, as it leads down a path that invalidates many of the arguments and methods used to achieve equality (a term no one wants to define in detail as well). At the highest level we should all have equality. But when we break down all of the ways an individual can be defined (gender, ethnicity, income, social class, sexuality preference, attractiveness, geography, athleticism, and so on and so on) it becomes almost impossible.

It’s their decision. I would only try and “interfere” if there was something like physical abuse going on, but not liking or trusting them? Who cares if I like their friends or not? It is not my business.It’s not a direct commentary on me and I for darn sure don’t care if they don’t like mine, so why would it go the other way?Edit to add: if they asked my opinion on them, I would try to give it in a tactful way but I would be honest. If they didn’t ask though, again, wouldn’t share unless something seems eminently dangerous.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f21efe161907a4407d613	00016b18b2--608f21efe161907a4407d613	APPROVED

"Ask in some of the ""no politics here"" witch subs here and witch groups on Facebook, and  you will get a very different answer, in part because of the whole ""colonize spirituality"" thing that a lot of white women (and many white men) get into.

(Before anyone gets upset: **Full respect** to *real* eclectic witches who have done their homework and are not willfully causing harm with their practices. **I'm not calling y'all out.** I'm calling out Becky WhitePerson and her ""I don't care if it hurts Native feelings when I use sage, feathers, and abalone—it's *my* practice and I'll hurt everyone I want!"" mindset.)Being a witch is inherently political. Most of us chose to follow this calling, and choosing to be a witch is choosing to side with marginalized people and spirits—and choosing to marginalize yourself in many ways. How can you, as a marginalized person, stand by or actively support a political force that causes harm to marginalized people? The boot right-wingers lick will eventually step on whyte supremacist ""witches"" as much as it steps on everyone else—and your support won't save you…or at least, it won't while letting you keep your Craft alive. But as with all things, their logic never adds up."	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f22982b838e4781316cb6	00016b18b2--608f22982b838e4781316cb6	APPROVED
Your dad was masked, and likely so was his colleague. I have been in an office twice this month with folks testing positive. We all were wearing masks and I have been negative. I test weekly for work. I’m also a healthcare worker. Colleagues and patients are testing positive near me left and right. It’s such a scary time. But it sounds like your dad is taking precautions seriously. I know it seems hopeless,  but we will get through it. Your dad was vaccinated today! So that’s a great start as well.

Tarot decks are one thing for focus, but you don't need them. All they began as were European playing cards. They are still just European playing cards in many cases. I saw my first tarot that way, being used by my Spanish grandfather and his friends.Before the 1960s, late, all card reading was done with poker decks. Look for older books to tell you what stood for what. It's the reader, not the cards, doing the work. (Even if collecting decks is one of my weak points. Love the art.)For that matter, I've designed two decks. They are my faves. Get a source on what they're supposed to mean, and make cards with a symbolism that works for you, that you can remember. Can't make pictures? Composite symbols in graphics programs or with old-school collage. Redesign them as you understand more. Like you, it can grow and improve.	1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f22982b838e4781316cb6	00016b18b2--608f22982b838e4781316cb6	APPROVED

If the woman wants to abort it, it’s her choice. But I don’t think men or women should have to pay child support for a kid they didn’t want(I’ve seen men force women to give birth and then the woman had to pay child support even thought she never wanted the kid)But overall, when it comes to abortion it’s the woman’s choice. A close friend of my mom wanted an abortion because she wasn’t financially or mentally ready for a child. Her husband screamed and forced her to not have an abortion and the mental strain the birth and the pressure he gave her caused her to become clinically depressed. After giving birth she checked herself into a mental hospital for 2 months. When she came back her husband was cheating on her.	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f23014277dd7e64653f6e	00016b18b2--608f23014277dd7e64653f6e	APPROVED

"In her 2004 book ""undoing gender"", Butler did attempt to differentiate between violent incestuous pedophilia and good consensual incestuous pedophilia. She argued that sometimes parent-child incest is not violation of children's rights, but denying the child's agency to consent to such relationships is the real violation -- ""the reification of the child's body as passive surface would thus constitute, at a theatrical level, a further deprivation of the child: the deprivation of the psychic life...so I keep adding this qualification : 'when incest is a violation', suggesting that l think there may be occasions in which it is not. Why would I talk that way? Well, I do think that there are probably forms of incest that are not necessarily traumatic or which gain their traumatic character by virtue of the consciousness of social shame that they produce....""

I think you’re making a false equivalency here with the idea that the women you mentioned = the common way women are depicted. You’ve also named a number of awesome ladies, but Anakin and Obi-Wan, Luke and Han and Chewie, Max himself and all the boys on the road. And those are just in those movies you listed, not the majority of movies that don’t even have female main characters.The ones you named are good examples to base your writing on, but even better? The women in your life. You sister, mother, friends.

When I was fourteen the boy a few streets over developed a crush on me. I talked to him to be friendly but eventually got creeped out. He would ask to walk me to and from school, he showered me with gifts, would tell on me to my parents if I didn’t give him extra attention and would come over my house several times per day when I wasn’t home and just sit outside or interrogate my family on where I was. He messaged me from every social media and made new ones whenever I blocked him (this was after my dad had to call the phone company and have his number blocked so he would stop texting me). He started having my friends leave me monster energy drinks during the school day, which I didn’t even like. He even showed up at my moms work once to ask her how I was and she didn’t even know him! I started seeing him stand outside of my house in the street sometimes just sort of wandering around outside my window and that’s when I got suuuuuper creeped out. I went outside one day and told him I didn’t like him and I was not ever going to like him with how he was acting. Next thing I knew he hated me and told all of our mutual friends I was a slut. By the time junior year came around he was still salty about it and occasionally I’d hear rumors he had spread about me. Once or twice throughout junior/senior year he messaged me saying he was sorry and still liked me. I saw him wandering outside my house a few more times. He offered to buy me more monsters, which I of course didn’t want, and when I turned them down he would get so sad and say something like “well, maybe someday....”. Ugh still creeps me out.	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f24624c606f0686654062	00016b18b2--608f24624c606f0686654062	APPROVED

Hello!I am part way through watching every single Ask A Mortician video and I'm really curious how this community views death. Natural burial has extreme green witch vibes, but almost all widely available options come with a level of ritul and respect that reminds me of some kinds of witchcraft.Originally, I wanted to be cremated. Most of my family has been cremated and I had no interest in rotting in a box, but I'm coming over more to natural burial. There's a place near me that does natural woodland burial - you feed trees and plants and every spring the whole wood is carpeted in bluebells, it's gorgeous and reminds me of where I grew up.Has anyone else given any thought to this?	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f24ac8342200cc3f4243b	00016b18b2--608f24ac8342200cc3f4243b	APPROVED

I give myself non-work related goals and hobbies. For example, asking myself what I can do to grow my side business. I have personal goals related to health and fitness.

I think that's fine. I even find that I gain more respect towards people who I don't find attractive right away. Through hanging out, as I learn more about them, I learn to appreciate them more and more. Of course, some people I will end up liking only as friends, some as something more.But for me it works better, cause if I find someone very attractive before knowing them properly, I make a big deal out of it in my head and just ruin the whole relationship before it even starts.I had it the other way around as well. I met up a few times with a guy who was clearly into me even though he didn't really know me that well and it felt awkward, honestly. I think when you are not attracted to someone right away, it kinda frees you and makes you get to know them properly, without any expectations.	1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f25f0dd05ff4c5a222618	00016b18b2--608f25f0dd05ff4c5a222618	APPROVED

Well, for one thing I drink a shitload less (ironic, given I’m back bartending). I don’t cry after work anymore. I don’t get written up for constantly being late and/or absent. Look, pretty much all jobs suck, because why else would we need to get paid to do it? If money wasn’t a concern, of course I wouldn’t work. But some jobs certainly suck a lot less. I got very lucky, and when things reopened in November I got a job offer at a really good venue and I’ve since been promoted. I come home from work late at night, dirty and tired but satisfied, and I sleep well at night. A bad day (night?) at work is just that -  a bad day.

Hello!I am part way through watching every single Ask A Mortician video and I'm really curious how this community views death. Natural burial has extreme green witch vibes, but almost all widely available options come with a level of ritul and respect that reminds me of some kinds of witchcraft.Originally, I wanted to be cremated. Most of my family has been cremated and I had no interest in rotting in a box, but I'm coming over more to natural burial. There's a place near me that does natural woodland burial - you feed trees and plants and every spring the whole wood is carpeted in bluebells, it's gorgeous and reminds me of where I grew up.Has anyone else given any thought to this?	1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f261b38e2f73c3f10b312	00016b18b2--608f261b38e2f73c3f10b312	APPROVED

"I don't understand how false rape accusations aren't a criminal offense in the US yet. Also, it was incredibly concerning when I searched ""is it a criminal offense to falsely accuse a person of rape in the US?"", and the first twelve (12!!!) PAGES of search results were all variations off ""what to do when falsely accused."" It took nearly 15 minutes for me to find a reliable source, and even then, it was a pretty cut-and-dry ""I mean, you could sue in civil court for defamation-- if you can afford it lol.""What the actual fuck? Make it a criminal offense. Place the responsibility on the government to hold people accountable and put them in jail for attempting to ruin lives in such an emotionally, mentally, and socially devastating way-- Lord knows every falsely accused person gets the media smear campaign before they've even seen a judge, so why the double standard for the people who blatantly set out to destroy lives just because they can get away with crying ""rape""?Jesus.

Although there's no draft, here's how it negatively affected me:I had to sign up for the draft the first year it was re-introduced, in 1980. I very grudgingly did so.Thirty years later, in 2010, my employer announced they would be closing my local office soon. About the same time the IRS announced they would be hiring soon for jobs for the following tax season. I applied, got called to in to take an aptitude test, and was interviewed. I was told that they really liked me, bit I needed evidence that I registered for the draft, and gave me the online address to ask for it. So I did.A few days later I got a call from Selective Service asking why I needed this. Apparently everything went online about 15 or 20 years before, but the older stuff was warehoused off-site. When I said it was for the IRS, they said something like, oh, yeah, they don't mess around. We'll send out to the warehouse and verify so we can send the document you need.Long story short, it took about a week for this to happen, and in the meantime all the positions they were hiring for were filled, mostly by women, who weren't held to the same standard. The people I interviewed with apologized and said they'd probably be hiring again in a year and I should apply again then.So, I missed out on a job opportunity because I had to jump through a hoop that many of the other applicants didn't, and the hoop was even higher for me due to my age.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f2738b30a2654b3194c4d	00016b18b2--608f2738b30a2654b3194c4d	APPROVED

"You're not railing against women? InterestingOK. Let's look at your post history (and let's not even delve into the comment history). - how dare feminists say my not crying is TOXIC!- why can't feminists accept men as they are! How dare they call us toxic. X2- feminists are making male suicide a competition!- toxic femininity! Women always have to be the victim!!- Saying ""toxic masculinity"" is derogatory!!- APA is sexist against men for pointing out detrimental behaviours and outcomes!- women are more cooperative during conflicts with attractive men.- complaining about a post being removed on askfeminists- men are sexually assaulted as much as women! If you can't see that you seem hyperfocussed on women, and the fact that they dare to advocate.for women's issues, or suggest that some typical, old-school behaviours are HARMFUL to the men displaying them... while at the same time defending to the death those same toxic traits that likely contribute to your own mental health struggles. In one reply you say to me that your suicidal ideation is the result of feeling upset about *your mother* and how she is stuck in a home, about witnessing her rape and beatings... and then you get sarcastic and aggressive when its suggested you get some healing and closure by advocating against domestic violence, because HOW DARE one suggest you only focus on what happened to my mother.

When I was younger, I was actively anorexic for several years. I think the world at large has gotten better about recognizing that eating disorders are not (wholly) about appearance, that every person has their own reasons behind their eating disorder.The thing that annoys me about the portrayal of anorexia is that it doesn’t seem to get any attention until the affected person is deathly thin. Eating disorders have a lot of bad health consequences, and short of dying of starvation, you don’t have to be shockingly underweight to suffer those consequences. When I was younger I was also diagnosed with bipolar II, though recently that diagnosis has changed to generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and depression. My own emotional immaturity, not understanding my own emotions, and the interplay of the two disorders probably contributed to the diagnosis of BPII and many years of heavy medication. So that’s another thing people don’t always know: these diagnosis typically aren’t set in stone, particularly if you were diagnosed fairly young, as I was. As far as daily life, I cannot recall a time where I was not anxious. Even  my earliest memories are tinged with anxiety. I’ve had suicidal thoughts on and off since I was an adolescent. As a result my view of “normal” is skewed. My anxiety is probably around a 5-6 on a low anxiety day (like on vacation, or a lazy Saturday). It’s not until I get to a 7+ that I start to notice it. I’m scoring on a 1-10 scale where 1 is no anxiety, 10 is pure out-of-the-blue panic attack.  If I’m below a 4, it feels weird. It feels like something is wrong. The easiest way to describe how my anxiety typically looks is to give an example. Most recently it was my covid vaccine. Initially planned on getting it as soon as I was eligible. Then I had people around me starting to pressure me to get it before I was eligible. When I feel that kind of pressure, I push back. I avoid. So then I decided I wasn’t getting it. Then I started obsessing. The anxiety got so bad on a daily basis that I broke, and on first day of eligibility I signed up, with the caveat that if I couldn’t get an appointment that week, and my fiancé wasn’t allowed to stay with me during the shot, I wasn’t going to do it. My conditions were met, still about had a panic attack getting the shot (I hadn’t had any shot for 20+ years).  But I got through it, and got my second one last week. None of my hesitancy was about the safety or efficacy of the shot. I don’t think there are microchips or I’m going to turn into a zombie.  It’s about feeling like I am able to make my own decisions without outside pressure.So that’s usually how it manifests. Have plan, feel backed into a corner I don’t want to be in, resist, obsess, then break as long as I can still feel like the driver of my own life. If I can’t, I double down.(If you know someone like me, the best advice I can give is back off. Let them know you’re available to talk if they want, but don’t try and force talk. If they do talk to you, try to be factual while a) acknowledging they are having anxiety and b) withholding judgement as much as you can.)	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f275c7a19413e31747fde	00016b18b2--608f275c7a19413e31747fde	APPROVED
Better public transit. I live near a city and I don't go out much because traveling means taking my car, and paying for parking (if it can be found) what's a walkable distance for most isn't for me, or I take longer to cover that distance which often means traveling alone.

"One thing that I absolutely love is how assault is a man's problem because ""most assaults are done by men""... and in the meantime we absolutely DO NOT give a damn about manipulation, psychological abuse, etc, that are acts of violence that are a lot more available and common for women. And yet, it's absolutely ignored; to the point where gaslighting someone is usually seen as ""acting on one's own freedom"" and that's it. Let alone manipulating someone into something.It's easy to have one-sided violence when you cherry-pick what matters as violence, and encourage other bad behaviour in the name of freedom. A vast majority of gold-diggers are women; let's say women to teach each other not to do it.That's not how it works? How strange. I've seen way too many women constantly using others as they see fit and discarding them without any issue, while being encouraged for it because ""you go girl"" to the point where even someone asking for basic respect was seen as outrageous and going against one's personal choices. Some of these situations resulted in suicide attempts because it was done on people they already knew were weak psychologically. But this isn't considered ""violence"". Meanwhile, innocent men are supposed to be ""nice"" enough to take the blame and do all the legwork when it comes to women's safety (I thought it wasn't women's job to work to make things better for men? Don't things apply in the same way in reverse?). While abusing others psychologically is pretty much seen as a non-event, at least when it comes to women.That's one of the things that sicken me the most in this society: cherry-picking what counts as ""violence towards others"". A man is a criminal for doing something as terrible, trigger warning, as looking at someone, but someone constantly lying and gaslighting others, while throwing them away like handkerchiefs once they're not useful anymore, is fine and is just ""personal freedom"". Either you really care about morality or you don't. And if you do, maybe it's time to take into account what is bad and abusive behaviour but isn't considered as such nowadays. It's a bit too easy to constantly ignore how one's action can ruin someone's psyche or life just because there was no punch involved (despite the fact that for men, said punch will be a crime even if it was self-defense).Yeah, sure, it's easy to lay the blame of any societal violence on ONE target when you cherry-pick what counts as ""violence"". Meanwhile, if some men are scared of female manipulation and decide not to meet one-on-one, they're ALSO blamed for being scared despite women having a lot more power when it comes to ruining your life either socially or psychologically, given how society works.Punching/killing someone is terrible. No question about it. But I always find it funny to see how other behaviours, that used to be, a fairly long time ago, seen as reprehensible, that can be just as dangerous and dehumanizing are all fine and dandy. And strangely enough, it's the kind of ""violence"" that is the most common for women. Funny how this works.According to this stupid comic, men absolutely are justified if they avoid contact with any and all women and refuse to associate with them, no matter how much it bothers them. Manipulation and psychologic abuse coming from women are a serious concern as well; and a concern that isn't even recognized by our society which makes it even more insidious; someone can mess with your head and make you suicidal, make you think that you're unworthy of the air you're breathing and that you shouldn't kill yourself, not because of yourself but because your blood would taint the poor wall behind you (a kind of message that I've heard multiple times from many friends), and it's all fine and dandy, it falls under the ""freedom"" category for these people. And that's not going into other problems, like manipulating men via lying into committing violence onto someone else. At worst, this person will be seen as a jerk. But it's not seen as ""equal"" as direct violence. Thus creating a disparity.Again, it's easy to twist violence numbers when you cherry-pick your ""violence"". An hypothetical country without any gun existing in it wouldn't have any gun-related death neither. It wouldn't say anything about any other case of death that isn't any better morally. And since these people are always trying to argue from a ""moral high ground""... The hypocrisy.Okay, then from now on all men should ""cancel"" women because the the risk of manipulation, gaslighting or abuse that is involved (and at least physical violence is punished; this almost never is in comparison, particularly when the perpetrator is a woman), and this isn't ""misogyny"", it's keeping any risk factor at bay. I reaaally wonder how this'll work out."	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f279938e2f73c3f10bee7	00016b18b2--608f279938e2f73c3f10bee7	APPROVED

This is the reason we need clear and unambiguous bodily sovereignty rights (including tissues) that require notarised legal consent for variation.If a couple agreed to something, then it should be auditable, else it didn't happen. As upsetting as that might be in this particular case, it would be more generally upsetting in society if we granted loopholes around rights to effectively nullify them and set a precedent.There would be many women in a similar position where their male partner died before being able to create a baby: it's unfortunate, but not a reason to set a precedent to invalidate rights (noting of course that those rights of which I speak do not exist yet).This should never become about property when it relates to human beings and their tissues.	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f279938e2f73c3f10bee7	00016b18b2--608f279938e2f73c3f10bee7	APPROVED

Nothing to do with gender difference. You’re basically not allowed to question feminism, especially in an intelligent or considered way.

"Been able to read threads here and on r/LeftWingMaleAdvocates to get some info and pointed to new knowledge for me. Been able to see some stuff on YouTube like raw interviews from The Red Pill and such. But when it comes to trying to find something that would be a deeper dive, it gets tough. Tried seeing if I could watch The Red Pill somewhere, but it's behind paywalls. Looked at my library to see what it's got. But my local library has zilch basically. The closest candidate I found for a ""men's rights"" book titled ""Why I'm not a feminist: A feminist manifesto"" but that's not really geared towards men's rights. But there were a nice number of options for feminist material. I might try looking at partner libraries more, but then there's also the question of how to actually access it. Like apparently one of the lending libraries does have web access for The Red Pill but the page I found it via doesn't actually give access. (Go figure.) And it's not like the library in my town is bad. It's actually very nice and well-funded. And there's been other times I get pleasantly surprised at what's available.

"One thing that I absolutely love is how assault is a man's problem because ""most assaults are done by men""... and in the meantime we absolutely DO NOT give a damn about manipulation, psychological abuse, etc, that are acts of violence that are a lot more available and common for women. And yet, it's absolutely ignored; to the point where gaslighting someone is usually seen as ""acting on one's own freedom"" and that's it. Let alone manipulating someone into something.It's easy to have one-sided violence when you cherry-pick what matters as violence, and encourage other bad behaviour in the name of freedom. A vast majority of gold-diggers are women; let's say women to teach each other not to do it.That's not how it works? How strange. I've seen way too many women constantly using others as they see fit and discarding them without any issue, while being encouraged for it because ""you go girl"" to the point where even someone asking for basic respect was seen as outrageous and going against one's personal choices. Some of these situations resulted in suicide attempts because it was done on people they already knew were weak psychologically. But this isn't considered ""violence"". Meanwhile, innocent men are supposed to be ""nice"" enough to take the blame and do all the legwork when it comes to women's safety (I thought it wasn't women's job to work to make things better for men? Don't things apply in the same way in reverse?). While abusing others psychologically is pretty much seen as a non-event, at least when it comes to women.That's one of the things that sicken me the most in this society: cherry-picking what counts as ""violence towards others"". A man is a criminal for doing something as terrible, trigger warning, as looking at someone, but someone constantly lying and gaslighting others, while throwing them away like handkerchiefs once they're not useful anymore, is fine and is just ""personal freedom"". Either you really care about morality or you don't. And if you do, maybe it's time to take into account what is bad and abusive behaviour but isn't considered as such nowadays. It's a bit too easy to constantly ignore how one's action can ruin someone's psyche or life just because there was no punch involved (despite the fact that for men, said punch will be a crime even if it was self-defense).Yeah, sure, it's easy to lay the blame of any societal violence on ONE target when you cherry-pick what counts as ""violence"". Meanwhile, if some men are scared of female manipulation and decide not to meet one-on-one, they're ALSO blamed for being scared despite women having a lot more power when it comes to ruining your life either socially or psychologically, given how society works.Punching/killing someone is terrible. No question about it. But I always find it funny to see how other behaviours, that used to be, a fairly long time ago, seen as reprehensible, that can be just as dangerous and dehumanizing are all fine and dandy. And strangely enough, it's the kind of ""violence"" that is the most common for women. Funny how this works.According to this stupid comic, men absolutely are justified if they avoid contact with any and all women and refuse to associate with them, no matter how much it bothers them. Manipulation and psychologic abuse coming from women are a serious concern as well; and a concern that isn't even recognized by our society which makes it even more insidious; someone can mess with your head and make you suicidal, make you think that you're unworthy of the air you're breathing and that you shouldn't kill yourself, not because of yourself but because your blood would taint the poor wall behind you (a kind of message that I've heard multiple times from many friends), and it's all fine and dandy, it falls under the ""freedom"" category for these people. And that's not going into other problems, like manipulating men via lying into committing violence onto someone else. At worst, this person will be seen as a jerk. But it's not seen as ""equal"" as direct violence. Thus creating a disparity.Again, it's easy to twist violence numbers when you cherry-pick your ""violence"". An hypothetical country without any gun existing in it wouldn't have any gun-related death neither. It wouldn't say anything about any other case of death that isn't any better morally. And since these people are always trying to argue from a ""moral high ground""... The hypocrisy.Okay, then from now on all men should ""cancel"" women because the the risk of manipulation, gaslighting or abuse that is involved (and at least physical violence is punished; this almost never is in comparison, particularly when the perpetrator is a woman), and this isn't ""misogyny"", it's keeping any risk factor at bay. I reaaally wonder how this'll work out."	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f29946917384f1b1930bd	00016b18b2--608f29946917384f1b1930bd	APPROVED

This is the reason we need clear and unambiguous bodily sovereignty rights (including tissues) that require notarised legal consent for variation.If a couple agreed to something, then it should be auditable, else it didn't happen. As upsetting as that might be in this particular case, it would be more generally upsetting in society if we granted loopholes around rights to effectively nullify them and set a precedent.There would be many women in a similar position where their male partner died before being able to create a baby: it's unfortunate, but not a reason to set a precedent to invalidate rights (noting of course that those rights of which I speak do not exist yet).This should never become about property when it relates to human beings and their tissues.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f29946917384f1b1930bd	00016b18b2--608f29946917384f1b1930bd	APPROVED

I'll keep this short and to the point. I'm not really a feminist but I'm definitely a ally. I got deep into that whole intellectual dork web (ugh I know) for a year but thankfully I decided to branch out and read so I've learned a hell of a lot since then. I'm still trying to learn.My 14 year old daughter and I were at a punk rock show last week. We go to them at least once a month, been great for bonding between us. While waiting for the first band to come on I noticed a younger woman probably early twenties was standing by herself looking a bit nervous. She was small and there are a lot of big guys around. I was a little worried she wouldn't be able to see the show or accidentally get stuck in a pit. I wanted to offer her to come up in front of the stage with my daughter and I. My daughter likes to be at the front and I stand behind her to protect her from anyone getting too rowdy. I'm a big dude, 6'3 240lbs so Im effectively a wall. Im a happily married man and have zero desire in this woman romantically. I ultimately decided I'd just watch out for her and if she got closer I'd offer her my spot in the crowd because I didn't want to creep her out or make her feel unsafe.Was that the right move?

Recently this meme was posted on a friend's facebook wall:> **When people find out that my dog is afraid of men:** Oh, the poor thing must have been traumatized when she was younger! Poor baby, I just want to hold and comfort her and let her know she’s safe.> **When people find out that I, an adult human woman, am afraid of men:** Um, not *all* men, sweetie. You can’t go your whole life being afraid. Get over it.> **When my dog was allowed to get a hysterectomy:** She doesn’t need to have puppies to have a happy, healthy like with her adoptive family.> **When I, an adult human woman, want to get a hysterectomy:** But having children will make you happy! You might change your mind!I want to preface this conversation with:1. I strongly believe that women suffer experiences through a variety of sources that may result in PTSD and other severe emotional trauma that may may them afraid of men. This is a thing that happens. This is not in question. People fail to recognize the severity of these traumas and say unhelpful stupid shit.2. Women have autonomy over their own bodies. If they choose to get a hysterectomy. It should be their choice. Women do have their choices for hysterectomies questioned and that's wrong. **BUT**The argument that the meme present is so full of holes that it frustrates and upsets me that it could undermine the feminist values that it is trying to defend. Maybe I need to let it slide... but if someone coming to this meme with any sense of caution might find that the argument fails to convince them and more over it may make them resistant to better arguments on the same subject in the future.Now, no argument is perfect, but there's some that are just cringeworthy.... like the one above IMHO.	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f29f9ae7378653b5b42b2	00016b18b2--608f29f9ae7378653b5b42b2	APPROVED

How Do You Feel About Asking For Your Girlfriends Fathers Blessing Before You Propose To Her? I probably wouldn't ask the father first but that's just me. I know it's tradition and it's a sign of respect but I don't feel like men should do it, the father dosen't own the daughter. If I had a daughter I would lover her more than anything and I would want the best for her but I personally wouldn't care if her boyfriend asked me for my blessing. Also I would tell my daughter weather or not I liked the boyfriend when I met him and women are adults and can make there own decisions, and even if the father says no the boyfriends is still probably going to propose, so what's the fucking point?	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f29f9ae7378653b5b42b2	00016b18b2--608f29f9ae7378653b5b42b2	APPROVED

Although there's no draft, here's how it negatively affected me:I had to sign up for the draft the first year it was re-introduced, in 1980. I very grudgingly did so.Thirty years later, in 2010, my employer announced they would be closing my local office soon. About the same time the IRS announced they would be hiring soon for jobs for the following tax season. I applied, got called to in to take an aptitude test, and was interviewed. I was told that they really liked me, bit I needed evidence that I registered for the draft, and gave me the online address to ask for it. So I did.A few days later I got a call from Selective Service asking why I needed this. Apparently everything went online about 15 or 20 years before, but the older stuff was warehoused off-site. When I said it was for the IRS, they said something like, oh, yeah, they don't mess around. We'll send out to the warehouse and verify so we can send the document you need.Long story short, it took about a week for this to happen, and in the meantime all the positions they were hiring for were filled, mostly by women, who weren't held to the same standard. The people I interviewed with apologized and said they'd probably be hiring again in a year and I should apply again then.So, I missed out on a job opportunity because I had to jump through a hoop that many of the other applicants didn't, and the hoop was even higher for me due to my age.	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f2aa86b43067ad4940f45	00016b18b2--608f2aa86b43067ad4940f45	APPROVED

"You're not railing against women? InterestingOK. Let's look at your post history (and let's not even delve into the comment history). - how dare feminists say my not crying is TOXIC!- why can't feminists accept men as they are! How dare they call us toxic. X2- feminists are making male suicide a competition!- toxic femininity! Women always have to be the victim!!- Saying ""toxic masculinity"" is derogatory!!- APA is sexist against men for pointing out detrimental behaviours and outcomes!- women are more cooperative during conflicts with attractive men.- complaining about a post being removed on askfeminists- men are sexually assaulted as much as women! If you can't see that you seem hyperfocussed on women, and the fact that they dare to advocate.for women's issues, or suggest that some typical, old-school behaviours are HARMFUL to the men displaying them... while at the same time defending to the death those same toxic traits that likely contribute to your own mental health struggles. In one reply you say to me that your suicidal ideation is the result of feeling upset about *your mother* and how she is stuck in a home, about witnessing her rape and beatings... and then you get sarcastic and aggressive when its suggested you get some healing and closure by advocating against domestic violence, because HOW DARE one suggest you only focus on what happened to my mother.

I'll keep this short and to the point. I'm not really a feminist but I'm definitely a ally. I got deep into that whole intellectual dork web (ugh I know) for a year but thankfully I decided to branch out and read so I've learned a hell of a lot since then. I'm still trying to learn.My 14 year old daughter and I were at a punk rock show last week. We go to them at least once a month, been great for bonding between us. While waiting for the first band to come on I noticed a younger woman probably early twenties was standing by herself looking a bit nervous. She was small and there are a lot of big guys around. I was a little worried she wouldn't be able to see the show or accidentally get stuck in a pit. I wanted to offer her to come up in front of the stage with my daughter and I. My daughter likes to be at the front and I stand behind her to protect her from anyone getting too rowdy. I'm a big dude, 6'3 240lbs so Im effectively a wall.

it took so long to find a safe space on this app to post about this.my boyfriend is a great guy, we live together and everything’s been going great. by far the most respectful man i think i’ve ever met. though a while ago we got into an argument where he ended up saying something about how he completely understands feminism because he was raised by his mom after his parents got divorced as a kid, and he’s had many conversations with her about feminine topics. earlier in the argument he said something about how i could never fully understand something because i hadn’t lived it, so i got defensive and angry and said by that standard he couldn’t fully understand feminism. he in turn got angry and said i was devaluing his experience, and that he does understand. i’ve heard his friends be very disrespectful while talking about women and he never calls them out for it. he’s very quick to make judgements on women’s’ appearances while we’re watching a tv show or movie. i don’t think he’s done any research on the topic, he tries to avoid uncomfortable conversations about it, is dismissive of statistics, and i don’t think he’s acknowledged his internalized misogyny (that we all have), in fact i think he’s in denial of it. i don’t know how to have a conversation with him about it, let alone bring the topic up to him. i think he would get angry again. i don’t know, maybe i’m being nitpicky about this. and maybe i’m just making unfair assumptions. TL;DRboyfriend says he fully understands feminism but has done no research, and (i believe) is in denial of his internalized misogyny. idk how to talk to him about it. i’d love to hear someone’s thoughts and maybe just talk about it.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f2c196efd841d656b338f	00016b18b2--608f2c196efd841d656b338f	APPROVED

She was the one who originally got me into feminism and taught me comprehensive sex ed through her videos. I always found her takes informative, well researched, and easily accessible. Her content always felt inclusive, and I learned a lot about the trans community, non-binary community, and social issues through her. I remember in 2016, she started dating Chris Ray Gun and debated Blaire White. She still more or less held (and holds) the same POV in her videos, it’s just that she’s more interested in discussions and discourse. Is this why people hate her so much now? I’ve seen multiple articles take more recent videos out of context, and it seems to me that several people read those articles and made their decisions based off that? I brought her up in feminist twitter, and people started talking about how Laci “went down a horrible path”...am I missing something?

When I was younger, I was actively anorexic for several years. I think the world at large has gotten better about recognizing that eating disorders are not (wholly) about appearance, that every person has their own reasons behind their eating disorder.The thing that annoys me about the portrayal of anorexia is that it doesn’t seem to get any attention until the affected person is deathly thin. Eating disorders have a lot of bad health consequences, and short of dying of starvation, you don’t have to be shockingly underweight to suffer those consequences. When I was younger I was also diagnosed with bipolar II, though recently that diagnosis has changed to generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and depression. My own emotional immaturity, not understanding my own emotions, and the interplay of the two disorders probably contributed to the diagnosis of BPII and many years of heavy medication. So that’s another thing people don’t always know: these diagnosis typically aren’t set in stone, particularly if you were diagnosed fairly young, as I was. As far as daily life, I cannot recall a time where I was not anxious. Even  my earliest memories are tinged with anxiety. I’ve had suicidal thoughts on and off since I was an adolescent. As a result my view of “normal” is skewed. My anxiety is probably around a 5-6 on a low anxiety day (like on vacation, or a lazy Saturday). It’s not until I get to a 7+ that I start to notice it. I’m scoring on a 1-10 scale where 1 is no anxiety, 10 is pure out-of-the-blue panic attack.  If I’m below a 4, it feels weird. It feels like something is wrong. The easiest way to describe how my anxiety typically looks is to give an example. Most recently it was my covid vaccine. Initially planned on getting it as soon as I was eligible. Then I had people around me starting to pressure me to get it before I was eligible. When I feel that kind of pressure, I push back. I avoid. So then I decided I wasn’t getting it. Then I started obsessing. The anxiety got so bad on a daily basis that I broke, and on first day of eligibility I signed up, with the caveat that if I couldn’t get an appointment that week, and my fiancé wasn’t allowed to stay with me during the shot, I wasn’t going to do it. My conditions were met, still about had a panic attack getting the shot (I hadn’t had any shot for 20+ years).  But I got through it, and got my second one last week. None of my hesitancy was about the safety or efficacy of the shot. I don’t think there are microchips or I’m going to turn into a zombie.  It’s about feeling like I am able to make my own decisions without outside pressure.So that’s usually how it manifests. Have plan, feel backed into a corner I don’t want to be in, resist, obsess, then break as long as I can still feel like the driver of my own life. If I can’t, I double down.(If you know someone like me, the best advice I can give is back off. Let them know you’re available to talk if they want, but don’t try and force talk. If they do talk to you, try to be factual while a) acknowledging they are having anxiety and b) withholding judgement as much as you can.)	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f2cde022d7b13cb8f3225	00016b18b2--608f2cde022d7b13cb8f3225	APPROVED
Better public transit.

Sorry that no one has responded. Anyway, I think it's problematic for a few reasons.1. It has a strange implication that women aren't capable of providing for themselves, so they are apparently entitled to a constant payment from their ex husbands.2. I think it is designed to further discourage divorce because our culture deems divorce scummy for some reason, even though the majority of marriages fail.3. I personally just flat out think it's unreasonable. I think the breadwinner of whatever relationship should pay a reasonable amount of money to their ex partner, giving the person enough time to get on their feet, financially. They should be legally compelled to find work that pays a living wage or else the payments will continuously get smaller and smaller. After the person gets back on their feet, the breadwinner is freed from these obligations.This last point may sound silly, but the amount of divorced women who re-marry and yet still receive alimony from their previous husbands is asinine.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f2d79591bb91d914ef5fd	00016b18b2--608f2d79591bb91d914ef5fd	APPROVED
I think it depends how old the customer is to be honest. Men sexualizing women is a huge problem; especially when the women are younger than the men. But I don’t feel like men have the same problem with women sexualizing them when they’re younger. Obviously, there are exceptions. Men can be harassed, too. But if they were clearly younger than you and you weren’t flirting with a minor or anything it seems to be okay. Then again, I’m not an expert. 	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f2d79591bb91d914ef5fd	00016b18b2--608f2d79591bb91d914ef5fd	APPROVED

You don't have a right to retaliate, that would be vigilantism. If attacked, you have the right for self-defense, and for that, you can use force appropriate to the danger. You also have the right to call the police/report it to the policy afterward, because it is a crime to physically attack someone. This is true regardless of gender. The problem might arise from how to interpret 'force appropriate to the danger'. It is generally assumed that women are weaker thus they can't represent a real danger to men, thus men using physical force is never appropriate to the danger a woman can pose to them, but that is a very harmful thinking based on gender stereotypes. Women can and in some cases do pose a threat to men, and if you are in that situation you have the right to defend yourself as good as you can, and if it's necessary, you can use force for that. That is the same if you are attacked by another man. You can't just retaliate and go and kill him. You can defend yourself, and cause physical harm appropriate to the threat.	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f2d79591bb91d914ef5fd	00016b18b2--608f2d79591bb91d914ef5fd	APPROVED

My husband and I have been together for 12 years. When we wanted to move to the outskirts of town and finally buy our first house, he was working 70 hour weeks. He stood back and trusted my judgement while I did all of the research and picked out our future home. He showed up on signing day and signed all of the papers and bought our home sight unseen because he trusted me and wanted me to be happy. At the time I was still fixing my credit from my parents using my identity to open utilities and he easily made 4x my salary. I felt so loved and was so excited about our future. I was telling girls at work about it and a single mom that loved to complain about her long string of extremely toxic relationships told me that she could never settle for a 'chump like that.'Excuse me? What? I just asked her how that was working out for her and walked away before she actually answered. Also, that was 5 years ago and this house is. So is the man sitting next to me that bought it with me. Both the house and the husband have only increased in value.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f2db54539ae2e0391b5f5	00016b18b2--608f2db54539ae2e0391b5f5	APPROVED

Oh, I was actually talking about something similar on another forum. Just because you do something voluntarily, doesn't mean everyone does. So in the example (this is not mine) of a party, maybe there's a cake. Now, some people are going to be excited to eat the cake, and enjoy it. Others will be reluctant but feel the pressure to eat it, so they aren't rude. Some may hate cake, so refuse to eat it, but the organizer of the party forces them to in various ways.The people who love or are indifferent about cake will think eating it is a choice, when it is actually never was. Of course, with makeup, there is an element of choice to it, but that choice can be really hard to see or actualize for some. For others, it is easier, but that doesn't mean the pressure goes away.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f2e2542e18f6d72f3d786	00016b18b2--608f2e2542e18f6d72f3d786	APPROVED

"My opinion in order of the point 1) sexual harassment can happen between couples and to assume otherwise should be obviously false. 2) I actually kind of agree with this one. Given the system we currently live in, if the most grave punishment was always called for, most universities would be unwilling to convict anything other than the most grave offense so most offenders would get away scott free. By using a gradient system, it is more likely that the offences deemed ""less serious"" would at the very least be condemned. Not a perfect system, but I understand the need for it. 3) yeah wtf with this one. What if they continue to assault you because you couldn't convict the first time? We have to just keep putting up with it until we're certain we can convict?

That's why a lot of men hate OnlyFans.

Hi, I have a question that I think this sub might be able to help me with. Not exactly about witches, but it is tangentially about the patriarchy, and how it effects me as a 29 year old heterosexual man. Over the last few years I’ve been coming to terms with the effects that toxic masculinity has on our society, including myself. It’s come at an unexpected cost though. throughout my adult life most of the women I’ve become romantically attracted started out as friends who over time exhibited qualities I would love in a partner. I’ve never acted on them in the past mostly for fear of rejection and also because I didn’t want my friends to think I only got close with them for the sole purpose of sleeping with them, which is definitely not the case; physical attractiveness is such a small part of what leads me to catch feelings. So I always let these attractions go and eventually the friendships fade in some of the cases. In all this I’ve learned that I’ve stopped trusting myself when I’m attracted to someone because I’m worried about the attraction being for the “wrong reasons.” as a result I’ve never fully learned how to approach the subject of romantic attraction with people who I’m attracted too and have been in an almost perpetual “unrequited love” mindset, weary of become a “nice guy” who thinks he’s owed something from the women he’s attracted to. There’s someone I like now and I really want to learn that I can trust myself with my feelings for her and that it’s not purely driven from a sexual attraction (although that’s there too.) I reaaaaallllly don’t wanna fuck this one up because she has every quality I’ve been searching for in a partner. she’s also very much awakened to her divine feminine and very perceptive, and I’m sure she senses my attraction to her.  I guess I don’t really have a question as much as I’m just looking for reassurance that being attracted to a friend isn’t inherently toxic and maybe ask for some direction on how to approach the subject of m romantic attraction with a woman who can see through everything.*edited to add clarity.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f2f042d4a1e497acab34a	00016b18b2--608f2f042d4a1e497acab34a	APPROVED

Hello, friends! Many moons ago I was complaining here about how I practically wished to reality a stray dog, a mere day after I thought about how I wanted to have a familiar. It seemed like fate BUT the owner, a kid, stoped by a few hours later looking for his puppy.Here is the part where you laugh: A few days ago I made a sigil asking for protection for my baby son, living so far away from me at this moment. I, then, asked my plants if any one of them would help me at this task. While none of them resonated specially against it, my dear berry bonsai practically yelled at me when I touched her.So, anyway, I already had a very loyal familiar and she is the best.	1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f2f042d4a1e497acab34a	00016b18b2--608f2f042d4a1e497acab34a	APPROVED

If the woman wants to abort it, it’s her choice. But I don’t think men or women should have to pay child support for a kid they didn’t want(I’ve seen men force women to give birth and then the woman had to pay child support even thought she never wanted the kid)But overall, when it comes to abortion it’s the woman’s choice. A close friend of my mom wanted an abortion because she wasn’t financially or mentally ready for a child. Her husband screamed and forced her to not have an abortion and the mental strain the birth and the pressure he gave her caused her to become clinically depressed. After giving birth she checked herself into a mental hospital for 2 months. When she came back her husband was cheating on her.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f2f7282989918dad72645	00016b18b2--608f2f7282989918dad72645	APPROVED

I have two brothers and they were both ushers at my wedding. After they seated the guests and the wedding party made their entrance, my brothers simply walked me down the aisle too.

"The oppression of women is not because of the interests of little girls or the aesthetic tastes of young women.  For years, when I was on Facebook as a young mom, every Christmas there would be a TON of posts about STEM toys for little girls.  As if the fact that little girls liking dolls is the reason grown women are pushed out of leadership positions in STEM fields and face discrimination, harassment and toxic work environments.  Spoiler alert-the reason was men and misogyny.Telling women what they should and should not wear IS the problem.  Telling women what they can and cannot like IS the problem. Shaming women for wearing dresses or liking pink because they are ""brainwashed"" is NO DIFFERENT from telling women they need to have a ""bikini body"" or that their bra straps are too distracting for boys to see.Furthermore, ""masculine"" traits and interests ARE NOT BETTER IN ANY WAY than ""feminine"" traits and interests.  The ONLY reason you think that is because those traits were associated with masculinity/femininity in the first place.  Pink is not a worse color than blue.  Pants are not better clothing than skirts.  Having short hair is not better than long.  Pretty and sparkly and fluffy and cute are not somehow demeaning to like.  It is beyond shameful and gross to judge and shame women for their genuine interests."	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f2f9a45926237b6edf233	00016b18b2--608f2f9a45926237b6edf233	APPROVED

I think that the best way to help is simply to always be a good example with your behaviour and to point out misogynistic comments, even when they're subtle. Especially if you're a man, I cannot tell you how relieving it is to see men recognizing them and be able to call them out.The best advice I can give you is to listen to women. Listen and understand when they're frustrated and complaining about some misogynistic behaviour that bothered them. Then put that into practice and encourage your friends to do the same.If you really want to join something, it all comes down to where you live and what you do in life. If you're still in school, in most universities you'll find some kind of feminist group, you could start there. Otherwise you can look for associations who help women in some kind of way and volounteer or give them money. At least in my country, they often rely solely on money from the State, then I guess donations are really welcome.	1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f2f9a45926237b6edf233	00016b18b2--608f2f9a45926237b6edf233	APPROVED

I didn’t experiment with drinking in high school like most of my friends/peers because I was so scared I’d become an alcoholic. When I was 21-23 I started going out and drinking quite a lot, 2-3x a week and got obliterated every time. I thankfully grew out of that fine and now have what I think is a very healthy relationship with alcohol. My fiancé has a history of alcoholism in his family as well so we both are cautious, but are fine to have a drink 1-2x a week and occasionally get drunk with friends (pre Covid). I’m happy that all of my siblings also have a healthy relationship with alcohol and we don’t seem to be perpetuating the cycle.	1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f2ffb6917384f1b19657c	00016b18b2--608f2ffb6917384f1b19657c	APPROVED

If I was a man I would be a ‘boss’ but since I’m a woman I’m ‘annoying’ and ‘too much’ and ‘creating drama’	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f30890b14ef5c4fcb4aa9	00016b18b2--608f30890b14ef5c4fcb4aa9	APPROVED

Giving myself a timeline and really sticking to it. If I have a major event happen like fighting with a friend or even falling out with someone, I'll allow myself to sit in the feelings for a bit. I can have 48 hours to be sad, cry, listen to sad music, kinda be reclusive and introverted, complain to friends and family about it. Then it's time to start healing; I may journal about the topic, meditate, try some breathing techniques, go for a walk, etc. Just to get the feelings out. Healing can take weeks and I may have bad days. But staying in that weepy, I can't function or do anything mood isn't healthy and I have to remember that too. If it's anger, I'll give it up to 24 hours. I can rage, go to the gym or go work out, journal, vent to a friend or family member, etc. I try not to make any major decisions in that time like no major purchases, nothin posted about it on social media, no blocking or unfriending, etc. Allow myself time to cool down and reevaluate how I'm feeling first before I decide to lash out in a permanent way. I may still be upset or frustrated after the 24 hours but then it's time to start working on slowly easing out of those feelings. Sitting in rage for too long puts the body in a fight or flight response which isn't healthy.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f30890b14ef5c4fcb4aa9	00016b18b2--608f30890b14ef5c4fcb4aa9	APPROVED
How time consuming it all is. You think if you own your own business, it would equate to you getting a lot of free time since you're your own boss!

I reconcile with the fact that there’s no such thing as wasted potential. When I woke up and realized that my journey was my own I was liberated from the expectations and pressures that had made me struggle for my whole life (even before the mental illness). A great book I’d recommend is the Artist Way by Julia Cameron. I also go to a therapist that has greatly helped me change how I perceive myself and life. You must humanize your journey. Life happens to the best and brightest, the hard times are just as much a part of that story as the others. Please don’t fault yourself ever for taking it slow and doing what you can to survive. After all that’s what humans are made to do, survive. You are not a robot that mindlessly works. And lastly, ask if your surroundings (friends, fam, work) are contributing to these feelings of hopelessness. My friends supported me and my craziest dreams even when they made absolutely no sense lol. They were a huge part of me unlearning a lot of my def destructive habits. I hope none of this sounds harsh. Sending you loads of love from someone who also has experienced this.	1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f30890b14ef5c4fcb4aa9	00016b18b2--608f30890b14ef5c4fcb4aa9	APPROVED

"The biggest mistake I see people make over and over is to decide what they believe in advance and then search for evidence that supports that.  Rational thought is the exact opposite: with an open mind, you seek out evidence, and then you let that evidence lead you to a logical conclusion.  The whole notion of the gender pay gap would have been GONE years ago if people would just take the ""evidence leads me"" approach.  But it's not just feminists who use ""conclusion first"" thought.  I see people on both the right and the left, or really from any political persuasion, go with ""conclusion first.""  It's very frustrating because it leads to millions of people who are 100 percent certain they're right when they're not.  It's the same reason the Catholic Church was ready to torture Galileo for refusing to support their totally wrong geocentric model of the universe.  Study after study, and article after article, shows that the earnings differences between men and women are due to different choices made and not by any gender bias, but the pay gap nonsense persists.  It's actually been illegal since 1963 (in the USA) to pay women less for the same work.  What I find most frustrating is that even questioning the pay gap is considered misogyny.  There is no idea on this Earth that is except from scrutiny.  Nothing should be exempt.  Whole wars have been fought over the belief that the God myth should be exempt. And I feel almost like it would start a war if I posted the link to one of the articles debunking the gender pay gap on my Facebook page.  There's nothing at all hateful about questioning an idea.  Even if the pay gap rebuttals were somehow wrong, those rebuttals are still not the same thing as hate.  It's frustrating.  It's rare to meet a person who goes evidence first.  But it's what everyone should do."	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608f30dbd0bdd872de3fa447	00016b18b2--608f30dbd0bdd872de3fa447	APPROVED

I find it quite amusing that their first example of sexism is „63% of women journalists have been confronted with verbal abuse“. Compare this to the infamous UNWomen tweet about 19% of journalists killed being women, indirectly showing 81% of those killed are men. Is verbal abuse against women worse than men literally being killed (not to mention considering how often male journalists face violence verbal abuse would also happen at a very high rate)? Why the hell use journalism as the first example of sexism and then still not even mention the fact that one sex is killed at over 4x the rate as the other. ...could it be.. men are expendable..?

It's very frustrating because it leads to millions of people who are 100 percent certain they're right when they're not.  It's the same reason the Catholic Church was ready to torture Galileo for refusing to support their totally wrong geocentric model of the universe.  Study after study, and article after article, shows that the earnings differences between men and women are due to different choices made and not by any gender bias, but the pay gap nonsense persists.  It's actually been illegal since 1963 (in the USA) to pay women less for the same work.  What I find most frustrating is that even questioning the pay gap is considered misogyny.  There is no idea on this Earth that is except from scrutiny.  Nothing should be exempt.  Whole wars have been fought over the belief that the God myth should be exempt. And I feel almost like it would start a war if I posted the link to one of the articles debunking the gender pay gap on my Facebook page.  There's nothing at all hateful about questioning an idea.  Even if the pay gap rebuttals were somehow wrong, those rebuttals are still not the same thing as hate.  It's frustrating.  It's rare to meet a person who goes evidence first.  But it's what everyone should do."	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608fc4666efd841d6573ee37	00016b18b2--608fc4666efd841d6573ee37	APPROVED

They spend their time validating a bunch of man-hating nonsense to eachother and continuously tell eachother that people criticizing their misinformation means they hate women and don't need to be taken seriously.The mere fact you don't accept the evidence they throw out at face value is, to them, evidence you are evil.

This is why I always freaking hate TikTok. The little 'trends' that go around are nothing more than just being a psychopathic sadist being horrible and cruel to people for no reason. I've heard stories of people hurting others just for a TikTok video, like kicking or punching them and then they get upset when the person jumps back.And look at this trending #Killallmen has done.

"One thing that I absolutely love is how assault is a man's problem because ""most assaults are done by men""... and in the meantime we absolutely DO NOT give a damn about manipulation, psychological abuse, etc, that are acts of violence that are a lot more available and common for women. And yet, it's absolutely ignored; to the point where gaslighting someone is usually seen as ""acting on one's own freedom"" and that's it. Let alone manipulating someone into something.It's easy to have one-sided violence when you cherry-pick what matters as violence, and encourage other bad behaviour in the name of freedom. A vast majority of gold-diggers are women; let's say women to teach each other not to do it.That's not how it works? How strange. I've seen way too many women constantly using others as they see fit and discarding them without any issue, while being encouraged for it because ""you go girl"" to the point where even someone asking for basic respect was seen as outrageous and going against one's personal choices. Some of these situations resulted in suicide attempts because it was done on people they already knew were weak psychologically. But this isn't considered ""violence"". Meanwhile, innocent men are supposed to be ""nice"" enough to take the blame and do all the legwork when it comes to women's safety (I thought it wasn't women's job to work to make things better for men? Don't things apply in the same way in reverse?). While abusing others psychologically is pretty much seen as a non-event, at least when it comes to women.That's one of the things that sicken me the most in this society: cherry-picking what counts as ""violence towards others"". A man is a criminal for doing something as terrible, trigger warning, as looking at someone, but someone constantly lying and gaslighting others, while throwing them away like handkerchiefs once they're not useful anymore, is fine and is just ""personal freedom"". Either you really care about morality or you don't. And if you do, maybe it's time to take into account what is bad and abusive behaviour but isn't considered as such nowadays. It's a bit too easy to constantly ignore how one's action can ruin someone's psyche or life just because there was no punch involved (despite the fact that for men, said punch will be a crime even if it was self-defense).Yeah, sure, it's easy to lay the blame of any societal violence on ONE target when you cherry-pick what counts as ""violence"". Meanwhile, if some men are scared of female manipulation and decide not to meet one-on-one, they're ALSO blamed for being scared despite women having a lot more power when it comes to ruining your life either socially or psychologically, given how society works.Punching/killing someone is terrible. No question about it. But I always find it funny to see how other behaviours, that used to be, a fairly long time ago, seen as reprehensible, that can be just as dangerous and dehumanizing are all fine and dandy. And strangely enough, it's the kind of ""violence"" that is the most common for women. Funny how this works.According to this stupid comic, men absolutely are justified if they avoid contact with any and all women and refuse to associate with them, no matter how much it bothers them. Manipulation and psychologic abuse coming from women are a serious concern as well; and a concern that isn't even recognized by our society which makes it even more insidious; someone can mess with your head and make you suicidal, make you think that you're unworthy of the air you're breathing and that you shouldn't kill yourself, not because of yourself but because your blood would taint the poor wall behind you (a kind of message that I've heard multiple times from many friends), and it's all fine and dandy, it falls under the ""freedom"" category for these people. And that's not going into other problems, like manipulating men via lying into committing violence onto someone else. At worst, this person will be seen as a jerk. But it's not seen as ""equal"" as direct violence. Thus creating a disparity.Again, it's easy to twist violence numbers when you cherry-pick your ""violence"". An hypothetical country without any gun existing in it wouldn't have any gun-related death neither. It wouldn't say anything about any other case of death that isn't any better morally. And since these people are always trying to argue from a ""moral high ground""... The hypocrisy.Okay, then from now on all men should ""cancel"" women because the the risk of manipulation, gaslighting or abuse that is involved (and at least physical violence is punished; this almost never is in comparison, particularly when the perpetrator is a woman), and this isn't ""misogyny"", it's keeping any risk factor at bay. I reaaally wonder how this'll work out."	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608fc5070bd4776cefb10e3c	00016b18b2--608fc5070bd4776cefb10e3c	APPROVED

This is the reason we need clear and unambiguous bodily sovereignty rights (including tissues) that require notarised legal consent for variation.If a couple agreed to something, then it should be auditable, else it didn't happen. As upsetting as that might be in this particular case, it would be more generally upsetting in society if we granted loopholes around rights to effectively nullify them and set a precedent.There would be many women in a similar position where their male partner died before being able to create a baby: it's unfortunate, but not a reason to set a precedent to invalidate rights (noting of course that those rights of which I speak do not exist yet).This should never become about property when it relates to human beings and their tissues.	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608fc5070bd4776cefb10e3c	00016b18b2--608fc5070bd4776cefb10e3c	APPROVED

I'll keep this short and to the point. I'm not really a feminist but I'm definitely a ally. I got deep into that whole intellectual dork web (ugh I know) for a year but thankfully I decided to branch out and read so I've learned a hell of a lot since then. I'm still trying to learn.My 14 year old daughter and I were at a punk rock show last week. We go to them at least once a month, been great for bonding between us. While waiting for the first band to come on I noticed a younger woman probably early twenties was standing by herself looking a bit nervous. She was small and there are a lot of big guys around. I was a little worried she wouldn't be able to see the show or accidentally get stuck in a pit. I wanted to offer her to come up in front of the stage with my daughter and I. My daughter likes to be at the front and I stand behind her to protect her from anyone getting too rowdy. I'm a big dude, 6'3 240lbs so Im effectively a wall. Im a happily married man and have zero desire in this woman romantically. I ultimately decided I'd just watch out for her and if she got closer I'd offer her my spot in the crowd because I didn't want to creep her out or make her feel unsafe.Was that the right move? Should I have just offered?	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608fc6a40b14ef5c4fd829d5	00016b18b2--608fc6a40b14ef5c4fd829d5	APPROVED
Recently this meme was posted on a friend's facebook wall:> **When people find out that my dog is afraid of men:** Oh, the poor thing must have been traumatized when she was younger! Poor baby, I just want to hold and comfort her and let her know she’s safe.> **When people find out that I, an adult human woman, am afraid of men:** Um, not *all* men, sweetie. You can’t go your whole life being afraid. Get over it.> **When my dog was allowed to get a hysterectomy:** She doesn’t need to have puppies to have a happy, healthy like with her adoptive family.> **When I, an adult human woman, want to get a hysterectomy:** But having children will make you happy! You might change your mind!I want to preface this conversation with:1. I strongly believe that women suffer experiences through a variety of sources that may result in PTSD and other severe emotional trauma that may may them afraid of men. This is a thing that happens. This is not in question. People fail to recognize the severity of these traumas and say unhelpful stupid shit.2. Women have autonomy over their own bodies. If they choose to get a hysterectomy. It should be their choice. Women do have their choices for hysterectomies questioned and that's wrong. **BUT**The argument that the meme present is so full of holes that it frustrates and upsets me that it could undermine the feminist values that it is trying to defend. Maybe I need to let it slide... but if someone coming to this meme with any sense of caution might find that the argument fails to convince them and more over it may make them resistant to better arguments on the same subject in the future.Now, no argument is perfect, but there's some that are just cringeworthy.... like the one above IMHO.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608fc6a40b14ef5c4fd829d5	00016b18b2--608fc6a40b14ef5c4fd829d5	APPROVED

How Do You Feel About Asking For Your Girlfriends Fathers Blessing Before You Propose To Her? I probably wouldn't ask the father first but that's just me. I know it's tradition and it's a sign of respect but I don't feel like men should do it, the father dosen't own the daughter. If I had a daughter I would lover her more than anything and I would want the best for her but I personally wouldn't care if her boyfriend asked me for my blessing. Also I would tell my daughter weather or not I liked the boyfriend when I met him and women are adults and can make there own decisions, and even if the father says no the boyfriends is still probably going to propose, so what's the fucking point?	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608fc6a40b14ef5c4fd829d5	00016b18b2--608fc6a40b14ef5c4fd829d5	APPROVED

In my experience, it honestly depends on the games you play. Call of duty, PUBG, black ops, rainbow6 etc all have people like you describe here. But games like Overwatch, apex legends, star wars Battlefront 2, etc. Are all very open to woman. I play an ungodly amount of Overwatch and I'd say 40% of all the players are girls. Which makes the community very welcoming, and wholehearted. But of course every once and a while you'll run into a douche bag, and in that case my only advice is to mute them.Hope this helps!	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608fd6214277dd7e646e0535	00016b18b2--608fd6214277dd7e646e0535	APPROVED

This woman, unattractive as she is, with very little English and not much else to distinguish her, is seeking the IMPOSSIBLY PERFECT husband, and she has left China to the USA to find him.  Her name is Luo Yufeng, or Fengjie, and she is a Chinese internet celebrity who left Shanghai in 2010 for America on a quest for a husband who meets her exacting standards.  He must have graduated from Yale or Harvard, or similar, have ambitions of world domination, cannot be Asian and preferably stands at 2m tall.  Yes, you read correct. he cannot be Asian. Why?

Oh, I was actually talking about something similar on another forum. Just because you do something voluntarily, doesn't mean everyone does. So in the example (this is not mine) of a party, maybe there's a cake. Now, some people are going to be excited to eat the cake, and enjoy it. Others will be reluctant but feel the pressure to eat it, so they aren't rude. Some may hate cake, so refuse to eat it, but the organizer of the party forces them to in various ways.The people who love or are indifferent about cake will think eating it is a choice, when it is actually never was. Of course, with makeup, there is an element of choice to it, but that choice can be really hard to see or actualize for some. For others, it is easier, but that doesn't mean the pressure goes away.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608fe126e161907a441165ec	00016b18b2--608fe126e161907a441165ec	APPROVED

"My opinion in order of the point 1) sexual harassment can happen between couples and to assume otherwise should be obviously false. 2) I actually kind of agree with this one. Given the system we currently live in, if the most grave punishment was always called for, most universities would be unwilling to convict anything other than the most grave offense so most offenders would get away scott free. By using a gradient system, it is more likely that the offences deemed ""less serious"" would at the very least be condemned. Not a perfect system, but I understand the need for it. 3) yeah wtf with this one. What if they continue to assault you because you couldn't convict the first time? We have to just keep putting up with it until we're certain we can convict?

That's why a lot of men hate OnlyFans. They love it when men are profiting off of womens bodies but if women are the ones in control and are profiting off of them and are showing that they have sexual agency, that pisses them off. It's about control. Who has the power?

Nothing to do with gender difference. You’re basically not allowed to question feminism, especially in an intelligent or considered way. That’s especially dangerous, so he had to go.On the other hand, had the guy been telling the pupils how bad men are (which is also saying there is a difference between the sexes), there would have been no problem.So it’s not about the message that men and women are different (which feminism will happily embrace when women are “better” than men), but more he dared encourage “wrongthink” and questioning the message that men are toxic.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608fe71c6b43067ad4a03fbe	00016b18b2--608fe71c6b43067ad4a03fbe	APPROVED

"Been able to read threads here and on r/LeftWingMaleAdvocates to get some info and pointed to new knowledge for me. Been able to see some stuff on YouTube like raw interviews from The Red Pill and such. But when it comes to trying to find something that would be a deeper dive, it gets tough. Tried seeing if I could watch The Red Pill somewhere, but it's behind paywalls. Looked at my library to see what it's got. But my local library has zilch basically. The closest candidate I found for a ""men's rights"" book titled ""Why I'm not a feminist: A feminist manifesto"" but that's not really geared towards men's rights. But there were a nice number of options for feminist material. I might try looking at partner libraries more, but then there's also the question of how to actually access it. Like apparently one of the lending libraries does have web access for The Red Pill but the page I found it via doesn't actually give access. (Go figure.) And it's not like the library in my town is bad. It's actually very nice and well-funded. And there's been other times I get pleasantly surprised at what's available.

"The biggest mistake I see people make over and over is to decide what they believe in advance and then search for evidence that supports that.  Rational thought is the exact opposite: with an open mind, you seek out evidence, and then you let that evidence lead you to a logical conclusion.  The whole notion of the gender pay gap would have been GONE years ago if people would just take the ""evidence leads me"" approach.  But it's not just feminists who use ""conclusion first"" thought.  I see people on both the right and the left, or really from any political persuasion, go with ""conclusion first.""  It's very frustrating because it leads to millions of people who are 100 percent certain they're right when they're not.  It's the same reason the Catholic Church was ready to torture Galileo for refusing to support their totally wrong geocentric model of the universe.  Study after study, and article after article, shows that the earnings differences between men and women are due to different choices made and not by any gender bias, but the pay gap nonsense persists.  It's actually been illegal since 1963 (in the USA) to pay women less for the same work.  What I find most frustrating is that even questioning the pay gap is considered misogyny.  There is no idea on this Earth that is except from scrutiny.  Nothing should be exempt.  Whole wars have been fought over the belief that the God myth should be exempt. And I feel almost like it would start a war if I posted the link to one of the articles debunking the gender pay gap on my Facebook page.  There's nothing at all hateful about questioning an idea.  Even if the pay gap rebuttals were somehow wrong, those rebuttals are still not the same thing as hate.  It's frustrating.  It's rare to meet a person who goes evidence first.  But it's what everyone should do."	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608fe7636efd841d6577f23a	00016b18b2--608fe7636efd841d6577f23a	APPROVED

Hi, I have a question that I think this sub might be able to help me with. Not exactly about witches, but it is tangentially about the patriarchy, and how it effects me as a 29 year old heterosexual man. Over the last few years I’ve been coming to terms with the effects that toxic masculinity has on our society, including myself. It’s come at an unexpected cost though. throughout my adult life most of the women I’ve become romantically attracted started out as friends who over time exhibited qualities I would love in a partner. I’ve never acted on them in the past mostly for fear of rejection and also because I didn’t want my friends to think I only got close with them for the sole purpose of sleeping with them, which is definitely not the case; physical attractiveness is such a small part of what leads me to catch feelings. So I always let these attractions go and eventually the friendships fade in some of the cases. In all this I’ve learned that I’ve stopped trusting myself when I’m attracted to someone because I’m worried about the attraction being for the “wrong reasons.” as a result I’ve never fully learned how to approach the subject of romantic attraction with people who I’m attracted too and have been in an almost perpetual “unrequited love” mindset, weary of become a “nice guy” who thinks he’s owed something from the women he’s attracted to. There’s someone I like now and I really want to learn that I can trust myself with my feelings for her and that it’s not purely driven from a sexual attraction (although that’s there too.) I reaaaaallllly don’t wanna fuck this one up because she has every quality I’ve been searching for in a partner. she’s also very much awakened to her divine feminine and very perceptive, and I’m sure she senses my attraction to her.  I guess I don’t really have a question as much as I’m just looking for reassurance that being attracted to a friend isn’t inherently toxic and maybe ask for some direction on how to approach the subject of m romantic attraction with a woman who can see through everything.*edited to add clarity.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608fe7895cddf57136b81ab2	00016b18b2--608fe7895cddf57136b81ab2	APPROVED

Hello, friends! Many moons ago I was complaining here about how I practically wished to reality a stray dog, a mere day after I thought about how I wanted to have a familiar. It seemed like fate BUT the owner, a kid, stoped by a few hours later looking for his puppy.Here is the part where you laugh: A few days ago I made a sigil asking for protection for my baby son, living so far away from me at this moment. I, then, asked my plants if any one of them would help me at this task. While none of them resonated specially against it, my dear berry bonsai practically yelled at me when I touched her.So, anyway, I already had a very loyal familiar and she is the best.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608fe7895cddf57136b81ab2	00016b18b2--608fe7895cddf57136b81ab2	APPROVED

My husband and I have been together for 12 years. When we wanted to move to the outskirts of town and finally buy our first house, he was working 70 hour weeks. He stood back and trusted my judgement while I did all of the research and picked out our future home. He showed up on signing day and signed all of the papers and bought our home sight unseen because he trusted me and wanted me to be happy. At the time I was still fixing my credit from my parents using my identity to open utilities and he easily made 4x my salary. I felt so loved and was so excited about our future. I was telling girls at work about it and a single mom that loved to complain about her long string of extremely toxic relationships told me that she could never settle for a 'chump like that.'Excuse me? What? I just asked her how that was working out for her and walked away before she actually answered. Also, that was 5 years ago and this house is. So is the man sitting next to me that bought it with me. Both the house and the husband have only increased in value.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608fe797591bb91d915baa9e	00016b18b2--608fe797591bb91d915baa9e	APPROVED

No, it doesnt make you gay, weird, or anything of the style.If we don't get compliments, then we can help it by a little bit by giving them, as seeing someone accept your compliment gives you about the same happiness than reciving one (On persona experience).And even if you get called gay what's wrong with it, just reply with a no and go find people worth your time.

Hello!I am part way through watching every single Ask A Mortician video and I'm really curious how this community views death. Natural burial has extreme green witch vibes, but almost all widely available options come with a level of ritul and respect that reminds me of some kinds of witchcraft.Originally, I wanted to be cremated. Most of my family has been cremated and I had no interest in rotting in a box, but I'm coming over more to natural burial. There's a place near me that does natural woodland burial - you feed trees and plants and every spring the whole wood is carpeted in bluebells, it's gorgeous and reminds me of where I grew up.Has anyone else given any thought to this?	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608fe7de42e18f6d72023852	00016b18b2--608fe7de42e18f6d72023852	APPROVED

"Its hard to say without being there, but in my experience these kinds of forces feed on your fear. Did you cleanse the house before moving in? If not I would literally sweep the house and use salt water to sever connections. If it's old and strong you may need help from your sisters to detach it. If you have any intuitive people (or animals!) in your life I would go room to room trying to find its ""nest"", or just the densest gathering of its energy so you can focus your intentions. Filling myself with light and compassion has been my go to in these scenarios which is hard when it ""attacks"" and you feel intrusive negativity. Friends help. Light helps. Love helps.

I've seen some arguments that the voynich manuscript doesn't seem like an actual language and it does seem convincing. There are of course languages which we can't decipher like linear-a apparently. But the voynich manuscript seems to consist of mainly very few letters. There's one letter that appears in almost every word and sometimes three times in a row. Overall apparently the text mostly consists of just few letters, and there are many that are barely used. Of course it's possible it is a very different kind of language from any european languages which could help explain the odd abundance of certain characters, but apparently many think the text is actually gibberish	1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608fe804d0bdd872de4ba9b0	00016b18b2--608fe804d0bdd872de4ba9b0	APPROVED

Oh, I was actually talking about something similar on another forum. Just because you do something voluntarily, doesn't mean everyone does. So in the example (this is not mine) of a party, maybe there's a cake. Now, some people are going to be excited to eat the cake, and enjoy it. Others will be reluctant but feel the pressure to eat it, so they aren't rude. Some may hate cake, so refuse to eat it, but the organizer of the party forces them to in various ways.The people who love or are indifferent about cake will think eating it is a choice, when it is actually never was. Of course, with makeup, there is an element of choice to it, but that choice can be really hard to see or actualize for some. For others, it is easier, but that doesn't mean the pressure goes away.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608fe83e4277dd7e646fa75d	00016b18b2--608fe83e4277dd7e646fa75d	APPROVED

"My opinion in order of the point 1) sexual harassment can happen between couples and to assume otherwise should be obviously false. 2) I actually kind of agree with this one. Given the system we currently live in, if the most grave punishment was always called for, most universities would be unwilling to convict anything other than the most grave offense so most offenders would get away scott free. By using a gradient system, it is more likely that the offences deemed ""less serious"" would at the very least be condemned. Not a perfect system, but I understand the need for it. 3) yeah wtf with this one. What if they continue to assault you because you couldn't convict the first time? We have to just keep putting up with it until we're certain we can convict?

That's why a lot of men hate OnlyFans. They love it when men are profiting off of womens bodies but if women are the ones in control and are profiting off of them and are showing that they have sexual agency, that pisses them off.

My husband and I have been together for 12 years. When we wanted to move to the outskirts of town and finally buy our first house, he was working 70 hour weeks. He stood back and trusted my judgement while I did all of the research and picked out our future home. He showed up on signing day and signed all of the papers and bought our home sight unseen because he trusted me and wanted me to be happy. At the time I was still fixing my credit from my parents using my identity to open utilities and he easily made 4x my salary. I felt so loved and was so excited about our future. I was telling girls at work about it and a single mom that loved to complain about her long string of extremely toxic relationships told me that she could never settle for a 'chump like that.'Excuse me? What? I just asked her how that was working out for her and walked away before she actually answered. Also, that was 5 years ago and this house is. So is the man sitting next to me that bought it with me. Both the house and the husband have only increased in value.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608fe844edc8e237c0dbaae7	00016b18b2--608fe844edc8e237c0dbaae7	APPROVED

"I've heard numerous accounts of anti-abortion activists having abortions and insisting that ""it's different for them, unlike all those immoral women who have them"".Personally I find the idea of women standing up for women to be largely nonsense. Maybe there is some statistical truth to it, and wishful thinking would like me to believe someone who's experienced some form of oppresion such as misogyny to be more sympathetic to others, but unfortunately there are plenty of people that for lack of better words lack a heart.

Sorry that no one has responded. Anyway, I think it's problematic for a few reasons.1. It has a strange implication that women aren't capable of providing for themselves, so they are apparently entitled to a constant payment from their ex husbands.2. I think it is designed to further discourage divorce because our culture deems divorce scummy for some reason, even though the majority of marriages fail.3. I personally just flat out think it's unreasonable. I think the breadwinner of whatever relationship should pay a reasonable amount of money to their ex partner, giving the person enough time to get on their feet, financially. They should be legally compelled to find work that pays a living wage or else the payments will continuously get smaller and smaller. After the person gets back on their feet, the breadwinner is freed from these obligations.This last point may sound silly, but the amount of divorced women who re-marry and yet still receive alimony from their previous husbands is asinine.	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608fe8f64c606f068671b200	00016b18b2--608fe8f64c606f068671b200	APPROVED
I think it depends how old the customer is to be honest. Men sexualizing women is a huge problem; especially when the women are younger than the men. But I don’t feel like men have the same problem with women sexualizing them when they’re younger. Obviously, there are exceptions. Men can be harassed, too. But if they were clearly younger than you and you weren’t flirting with a minor or anything it seems to be okay. Then again, I’m not an expert. 	1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608fe8f64c606f068671b200	00016b18b2--608fe8f64c606f068671b200	APPROVED

You also have the right to call the police/report it to the policy afterward, because it is a crime to physically attack someone. This is true regardless of gender. The problem might arise from how to interpret 'force appropriate to the danger'. It is generally assumed that women are weaker thus they can't represent a real danger to men, thus men using physical force is never appropriate to the danger a woman can pose to them, but that is a very harmful thinking based on gender stereotypes. Women can and in some cases do pose a threat to men, and if you are in that situation you have the right to defend yourself as good as you can, and if it's necessary, you can use force for that. That is the same if you are attacked by another man. You can't just retaliate and go and kill him. You can defend yourself, and cause physical harm appropriate to the threat.	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608fe8f64c606f068671b200	00016b18b2--608fe8f64c606f068671b200	APPROVED

I didn’t experiment with drinking in high school like most of my friends/peers because I was so scared I’d become an alcoholic.

If I was a man I would be a ‘boss’ but since I’m a woman I’m ‘annoying’ and ‘too much’ and ‘creating drama’	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608fe9958342200cc303ea09	00016b18b2--608fe9958342200cc303ea09	APPROVED

Giving myself a timeline and really sticking to it. If I have a major event happen like fighting with a friend or even falling out with someone, I'll allow myself to sit in the feelings for a bit. I can have 48 hours to be sad, cry, listen to sad music, kinda be reclusive and introverted, complain to friends and family about it. Then it's time to start healing; I may journal about the topic, meditate, try some breathing techniques, go for a walk, etc. Just to get the feelings out. Healing can take weeks and I may have bad days. But staying in that weepy, I can't function or do anything mood isn't healthy and I have to remember that too. If it's anger, I'll give it up to 24 hours. I can rage, go to the gym or go work out, journal, vent to a friend or family member, etc. I try not to make any major decisions in that time like no major purchases, nothin posted about it on social media, no blocking or unfriending, etc. Allow myself time to cool down and reevaluate how I'm feeling first before I decide to lash out in a permanent way. I may still be upset or frustrated after the 24 hours but then it's time to start working on slowly easing out of those feelings. Sitting in rage for too long puts the body in a fight or flight response which isn't healthy.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608fe9958342200cc303ea09	00016b18b2--608fe9958342200cc303ea09	APPROVED
How time consuming it all is. You think if you own your own business, it would equate to you getting a lot of free time since you're your own boss! But if I don't work on my business every day, then customers don't get what they ordered on time and my 300+ 5 star reviews would suffer. So I wish I knew how time consuming it all is.

I reconcile with the fact that there’s no such thing as wasted potential. When I woke up and realized that my journey was my own I was liberated from the expectations and pressures that had made me struggle for my whole life (even before the mental illness). A great book I’d recommend is the Artist Way by Julia Cameron. I also go to a therapist that has greatly helped me change how I perceive myself and life. You must humanize your journey. Life happens to the best and brightest, the hard times are just as much a part of that story as the others. Please don’t fault yourself ever for taking it slow and doing what you can to survive. After all that’s what humans are made to do, survive. You are not a robot that mindlessly works. And lastly, ask if your surroundings (friends, fam, work) are contributing to these feelings of hopelessness. My friends supported me and my craziest dreams even when they made absolutely no sense lol. They were a huge part of me unlearning a lot of my def destructive habits. I hope none of this sounds harsh. Sending you loads of love from someone who also has experienced this.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608fe9958342200cc303ea09	00016b18b2--608fe9958342200cc303ea09	APPROVED

"Women have been doing this sort of thing for a very long time now.Men started walking away in droves in Japan.  Decades later, the birth rate plummeted and the whole country asked ""What is going on here""  Women replied ""Men are just not enough for us""  Not one mention of the actual reason. Men walked away.Just this week I saw a story about how a proud powerful clever black woman created a meme. As it turns out, it was a derivative of a [derivative of the Wojak](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/black-wojaks) meme. Again, no mention of the origin of that meme.Now, nearly a decade into full blown MGTOW and the rise of the Red Pill, women are as desperate as ever.  They look around at each other with genuine clueless incredulity asking each other ""Where are all the good men"".  We have an ENTIRE FUCKING SUB dedicated to this.  Their response?  ""The study found that there is a shortage of ‘economically attractive partners for unmarried women to marry’.""In other words, ""Men just suck""I am glad for this.

maybe this is an unpopular opinion in feminism, but I really dislike the whole 'onlyfans' and sexualised nudity on social media... which women claim is 'empowering'. I get to some people might feel temporarily 'empowered' to choose when to show off their body but what they are ultimately doing is objectifying themselves for the visual pleasure of others. They are doing it for the likes, for the attention and for the praise and with only fans - for the money. Is something that is done entirely for the public praise of doing it ever truly 'empowering'? I don’t buy that its done for the individual posting it - because why post to a public forum.. just BE naked or pose sexy, on your own if it is just for you. I think maybe we have gotten caught up in an idea that anything women do is inherently okay because 'feminism' and to raise a point against it is somehow anti-feminist. I think onlyfans and sexual provocation/nudity on social media devalues the female form, the brain of the woman, the achievements of the woman. And not just the women in question it devalues either so I think it goes beyond 'personal choice' but it also perpetuates that mentality of objectification... that women should be attractive and sexy and alluring etc etc etc I think it just flies in the face of everything feminists have tried to achieve for the female sex. You don’t see top CEOs or high achieving men like Elon Musk, Jordan Peterson, Joe Rogan slapping their balls on Instagram and say it makes them feel good about themselves (for this to make sense you also have to imagine a world run my women who constantly objectify men’s balls - and use them to sell almost everything to the masses). Now, I’m not a prude, I have my insecurities but I am pretty much always naked at home and I don’t entirely mind if someone outside sees me, I’m not trying to be seen but I’m pretty comfortable being naked at home, I’d skinny dip in a heart beat, ive had naked drunken baths with friends and I love nudist beaches so this opinion isn’t coming from the perspective of someone who is necessarily just skin shy. I was, however, abused as a child. Possibly from before the age of 4, a time which I have no memory of. and I can’t help but think that the oversexualisation of women is a key factor in men treating women in the disgusting ways that they sometimes do. It is because they do not see them as equal, in cognitive or social or physical ability and I think when we push our tits together in a forever21 tank top with an arched back and a bit of side bum showing with some cheap ass caption of ''feel like an empowered woman, hbu?' it makes a f\*\*\*\*\*\* mockery of actual empowered women striving to make a big difference in this world and cutting through the corporate male dominated world where men’s heads are swimming with this kind of lurid imagery every time we give a presentation, host an event or lead on a business deal. Just do us all a favour and stop it. Or... please, please, convince me that I am wrong?	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608fe9bc022d7b13cb998839	00016b18b2--608fe9bc022d7b13cb998839	APPROVED

In my experience, it honestly depends on the games you play. Call of duty, PUBG, black ops, rainbow6 etc all have people like you describe here. But games like Overwatch, apex legends, star wars Battlefront 2, etc. Are all very open to woman. I play an ungodly amount of Overwatch and I'd say 40% of all the players are girls. Which makes the community very welcoming, and wholehearted. But of course every once and a while you'll run into a douche bag, and in that case my only advice is to mute them.Hope this helps!	1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608fe9f48b0a8f250df73f2b	00016b18b2--608fe9f48b0a8f250df73f2b	APPROVED

A quick google search shows he’s a leftist activist and politician who founded a workers party which made him a threat to the state and an enemy of capitalism who was eventually abducted by Turkish CIA. I am a believer in oppression ultimately coming from the economic need. and I appreciate how he frames women as one of the earliest people oppressed by society as women’s unpaid Labour is so much more valuable than people ever think	1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608fea236fb3ed62c9279ba8	00016b18b2--608fea236fb3ed62c9279ba8	APPROVED
"So, I have been called a TERF and a bigot. I think the issue is there is no room for discussion on serious topics. I have always been a trans ally, always felt strongly about equal rights. Here in Ontario, we have self-ID. I was supportive of self-ID, although it was kind of pushed through as law without the public knowing. There is a case here, where a man self-IDd as a woman, and was put in a low security prison.  When he was released, he started identifying as a man again. Here is the issue- while in prison, there were reports of him harassing inmates for sex, hitting on them, Intimidating them - and he sexually assaulted inmates. One has come forward and laid charges against him.  This was a huge eye-opener for me. While I support transwomen, actual transwomen, some laws started with good intentions are being abused - by MEN. It gives transwomen a bad rep.  When I try to discuss this very serious issue, I am shut down being called a bigot and TERF. Blocked before anyone will listen.  There needs to be reform with this law to protect women from predatory men.I get so upset, that female victims are being silenced on this issue, and so called feminist disregard these victims in  place of virtu-signally.It upsets me, that our media is keeping this case quiet - there is a narrative and nothing can question it.As feminist, we should be able to discuss all issues women face, without being bullied into silence.  Transwomen should be listening imo, bc these men are going to destroy all the work for equality that older transpeople have fought hard for. Having the public finally understand the pain of dysphoria, just to have sick men use their rights for their own sick, twisted ways.  None of our msm will report this case. This happened at a prison near me, and have spoken with other women who were housed with this man, and heard their experiences. All I have asked was for a discussion to find a compromise that keeps both transwomen and cis women safe from predatory men, and that makes me a.bigot apparently.  Anyone who does discuss it, basically says ""well its rare, shit happens"". What was the point of the  meetoo movement if we are to jjst suck it up and accept women will get raped?  Here is a link.  FYI, the term rape is not used in canada. We use ""sexual assault"" to various degrees. This case did involve penetration and violence.https://www.womenarehuman.com/transgender-inmate-charged-with-sexual-assault-at-a-womens-prison/"	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608fea236fb3ed62c9279ba8	00016b18b2--608fea236fb3ed62c9279ba8	APPROVED

What you are experiencing is really common, especially at your age. I’m a 24 year old male pursuing a doctoral degree in healthcare, and during my education I’ve taken feminist theory, philosophy of sex and love, psychology of interpersonal dynamics, and some other classes on administration. In addition, throughout my college experience I’ve had met people that are in relationships that are harmful to them, people that are victims of abuse, and been in bad relationships myself. Some of these people I’ve met are by best friends now, but it took years to build trust or enable them to change their mindset to one that is healthy enough to be independent. The perspective I’ve gotten from that experience has shown me a few things that can help you navigate what you are talking about. The most helpful thing is to model positive relationships. When a person has an abuser (this could even mean an unhealthy relationship, including those that enable patriarchal behavior) in their life, they need a support system because they are victims. We need to show them kindness, allow them to talk about their problems, and let them know we love them exactly as they are. People do not respond well to being told what to do, even when we view the solution (such as breaking up) to be clear. When we tell a distressed person what to do or think, we model the same behavior that the abuser is using. “It’s normal for men to see strippers and you are a prude for not letting me” is along the same line as “you should break up with him because he is wrong and hurting you”, even if I agree with the latter statement much more. By using terms like “if he is breaking the boundaries of your relationship, what do you think is a way to clarify to him that you need different things” and “you are not “that girl”, I think you are wonderful and everything you’re saying makes sense. I’m going to be here for you no matter what you decide to do, and will help you through it” are much more empowering statements that encourage communication and problem solving, while also demonstrating care and respect. I’ve found you can never tell someone to break up with their partner, but you can demonstrate that there is better love out there, and make them feel supported enough to make the jump of ending a relationship (which is REALLY scary because no one likes to feel alone). Over time, the person feels enough support to be able to make that life change because they have you. It takes time, but by being there for people and loving them you are doing good. Eventually, people do ask about what I believe, why I have been there for them, and when those questions come out a real foundation of meaningful friendship can be made. Sometimes people continue to choose unhealthy men that can’t communicate or understand that relationships mean caring for another’s happiness, even if it means not going to strip clubs (these are the immature ones). Learning open and two way communication is really hard, especially when you’re 18. But you’re learning it, and it’s a wonderful process that will create meaningful and  lasting relationships. Being there for people has been my way of finding meaning in my life, and I hope you can help your friends move on to better men that listen, care, and work toward mutual happiness and love.	1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608fea236fb3ed62c9279ba8	00016b18b2--608fea236fb3ed62c9279ba8	APPROVED

> That woman: Starts a protest and new wave of feminism.I dislike that it is reality. Body positivism as an idea isn't necessarily a bad one, but holy crap is it a sexist, corrupt movement. Craps all over women who actually decide to lose weight too.While it might be mostly women, but an awful lot of people these days don't seem to be very introspective. So props to your girlfriend for actually having a growth moment, but shes very much the minority unfortunately.One thing studying psychology taught me is how biases work and its been very...self enlightening to think about my own. I'm not perfect, but i can do pretty well at separating my subjective view and the objective(if possible) view. The one issue i have is i am quite righteous, because i try my best to align with objective truths and sometimes the 'i am right' view just pops out.For me, i'm not into that fat lady, i wouldn't call her specifically, ugly, but her arms definitely are.

The law ratio (laws lobbied for by feminists for women and for men) and growing bias towards men shows the original motives of the 1st wave. Since people didn’t have stats and surveys to see the downsides of being men, they meant by equality to move up and be equal that way because they saw the obvious fact they were put below men. therefore, they mean “get better laws to be on par with men” rather then “make men and women equal in all ways” which explains why they act the way they act and why it doesn’t seem to live up with the latter defention. They didn’t know how bad it was.

Hi, I have a question that I think this sub might be able to help me with. Not exactly about witches, but it is tangentially about the patriarchy, and how it effects me as a 29 year old heterosexual man. Over the last few years I’ve been coming to terms with the effects that toxic masculinity has on our society, including myself. It’s come at an unexpected cost though. throughout my adult life most of the women I’ve become romantically attracted started out as friends who over time exhibited qualities I would love in a partner. I’ve never acted on them in the past mostly for fear of rejection and also because I didn’t want my friends to think I only got close with them for the sole purpose of sleeping with them, which is definitely not the case; physical attractiveness is such a small part of what leads me to catch feelings. So I always let these attractions go and eventually the friendships fade in some of the cases. In all this I’ve learned that I’ve stopped trusting myself when I’m attracted to someone because I’m worried about the attraction being for the “wrong reasons.” as a result I’ve never fully learned how to approach the subject of romantic attraction with people who I’m attracted too and have been in an almost perpetual “unrequited love” mindset, weary of become a “nice guy” who thinks he’s owed something from the women he’s attracted to. There’s someone I like now and I really want to learn that I can trust myself with my feelings for her and that it’s not purely driven from a sexual attraction (although that’s there too.) I reaaaaallllly don’t wanna fuck this one up because she has every quality I’ve been searching for in a partner. she’s also very much awakened to her divine feminine and very perceptive, and I’m sure she senses my attraction to her.  I guess I don’t really have a question as much as I’m just looking for reassurance that being attracted to a friend isn’t inherently toxic and maybe ask for some direction on how to approach the subject of m romantic attraction with a woman who can see through everything.*edited to add clarity.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608fea84edc8e237c0dbca7d	00016b18b2--608fea84edc8e237c0dbca7d	APPROVED

Hello, friends! Many moons ago I was complaining here about how I practically wished to reality a stray dog, a mere day after I thought about how I wanted to have a familiar. It seemed like fate BUT the owner, a kid, stoped by a few hours later looking for his puppy.Here is the part where you laugh: A few days ago I made a sigil asking for protection for my baby son, living so far away from me at this moment.

It depends on your native language and culture. For me, it’s fine.For your reference to South Asian culture, I know there are two words, one word “未婚“ which means “not (yet) married” is neutral and used for both male and female. The other word “剩女” which means “leftover female” has negative connotation.	1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608feaa9c00a69225ed93bcc	00016b18b2--608feaa9c00a69225ed93bcc	APPROVED

In my experience, it honestly depends on the games you play. Call of duty, PUBG, black ops, rainbow6 etc all have people like you describe here. But games like Overwatch, apex legends, star wars Battlefront 2, etc. Are all very open to woman. I play an ungodly amount of Overwatch and I'd say 40% of all the players are girls. Which makes the community very welcoming, and wholehearted. But of course every once and a while you'll run into a douche bag, and in that case my only advice is to mute them.Hope this helps!	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608feaa9c00a69225ed93bcc	00016b18b2--608feaa9c00a69225ed93bcc	APPROVED

maybe this is an unpopular opinion in feminism, but I really dislike the whole 'onlyfans' and sexualised nudity on social media... which women claim is 'empowering'. I get to some people might feel temporarily 'empowered' to choose when to show off their body but what they are ultimately doing is objectifying themselves for the visual pleasure of others. They are doing it for the likes, for the attention and for the praise and with only fans - for the money. Is something that is done entirely for the public praise of doing it ever truly 'empowering'? I don’t buy that its done for the individual posting it - because why post to a public forum.. just BE naked or pose sexy, on your own if it is just for you. I think maybe we have gotten caught up in an idea that anything women do is inherently okay because 'feminism' and to raise a point against it is somehow anti-feminist. I think onlyfans and sexual provocation/nudity on social media devalues the female form, the brain of the woman, the achievements of the woman. And not just the women in question it devalues either so I think it goes beyond 'personal choice' but it also perpetuates that mentality of objectification... that women should be attractive and sexy and alluring etc etc etc I think it just flies in the face of everything feminists have tried to achieve for the female sex. You don’t see top CEOs or high achieving men like Elon Musk, Jordan Peterson, Joe Rogan slapping their balls on Instagram and say it makes them feel good about themselves (for this to make sense you also have to imagine a world run my women who constantly objectify men’s balls - and use them to sell almost everything to the masses). Now, I’m not a prude, I have my insecurities but I am pretty much always naked at home and I don’t entirely mind if someone outside sees me, I’m not trying to be seen but I’m pretty comfortable being naked at home, I’d skinny dip in a heart beat, ive had naked drunken baths with friends and I love nudist beaches so this opinion isn’t coming from the perspective of someone who is necessarily just skin shy. I was, however, abused as a child. Possibly from before the age of 4, a time which I have no memory of. and I can’t help but think that the oversexualisation of women is a key factor in men treating women in the disgusting ways that they sometimes do. It is because they do not see them as equal, in cognitive or social or physical ability and I think when we push our tits together in a forever21 tank top with an arched back and a bit of side bum showing with some cheap ass caption of ''feel like an empowered woman, hbu?' it makes a f\*\*\*\*\*\* mockery of actual empowered women striving to make a big difference in this world and cutting through the corporate male dominated world where men’s heads are swimming with this kind of lurid imagery every time we give a presentation, host an event or lead on a business deal. Just do us all a favour and stop it.

If the woman wants to abort it, it’s her choice. But I don’t think men or women should have to pay child support for a kid they didn’t want(I’ve seen men force women to give birth and then the woman had to pay child support even thought she never wanted the kid)But overall, when it comes to abortion it’s the woman’s choice. A close friend of my mom wanted an abortion because she wasn’t financially or mentally ready for a child. Her husband screamed and forced her to not have an abortion and the mental strain the birth and the pressure he gave her caused her to become clinically depressed. After giving birth she checked herself into a mental hospital for 2 months. When she came back her husband was cheating on her.	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608feabe3d2e6f2678ddcb69	00016b18b2--608feabe3d2e6f2678ddcb69	APPROVED

"It really depends on what you mean by ""porn"".  Sex is an integral part of the human experience and as such subject to artistic interpretation.  So taken in a broader sense as ""depiction of sexual acts"" there is nothing wrong with it provided it does not normalize sexual assault.On the other hand so called ""hardcore"" pornography requires the viewer to understand that the depicted acts are not simulated.  This *is* a problem because it takes away the viewer as a participant in the interpretation of the viewed act and warps the sense of what sex should be to the idea of something that is being done to someone and thus does normalize sexual assault.That is not to say that any depiction of non-simulated sexual acts would be wrong, just that the current hardocre pornography that relies on this fact as its marketing focus is."	1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608feadc8342200cc303fcae	00016b18b2--608feadc8342200cc303fcae	APPROVED

Genuine question: I see people in this thread arguing about whether the no uterus no opinion thing is exclusionary. My question is, should trans women really be included in the abortion conversation? I’m not a TERF or anything, I fully believe trans women are real women and that they belong in the feminist movement. I just think that for an issue like this, where a trans woman (for example) will never have to get an abortion, be subjected to being turned away for one, nor jailed for seeking one, should their inclusion in the conversation really be of concern?

Genuine question: I see people in this thread arguing about whether the no uterus no opinion thing is exclusionary. My question is, should trans women really be included in the abortion conversation? I’m not a TERF or anything, I fully believe trans women are real women and that they belong in the feminist movement. I just think that for an issue like this, where a trans woman (for example) will never have to get an abortion, be subjected to being turned away for one, nor jailed for seeking one, should their inclusion in the conversation really be of concern?

I dated a borderline personality disorder feminist, so I can't pull the two apart for what was responsible between those two issues. I was a feminist at the time and let her walk all over me though, which was due to my own issues at the time, I was a bit masochistic and already felt ashamed of being a man and of my masculinity. Luckily it was a long distance relationship so I was protected a lot by that. It was still a huge struggle and I was dehumanized and shamed constantly. I kept telling myself, well she doesn't mean me! I'm a good one! That wasn't actually protecting me from the damage to my self-esteem it created. She would do things like attack me for sending her sexy pics, I think because she had some envy issues or something, I couldn't make sense of it. Eventually it fell apart because I idiotically tried to protect her from some bad influences in her life, and that included a psycho that made up a bunch of horrible things about me once I asserted myself to cut me off from their circle in general.

I'd say we depend on each other for different things. Any car related or mechanical is 100% his area.

Giving myself a timeline and really sticking to it. If I have a major event happen like fighting with a friend or even falling out with someone, I'll allow myself to sit in the feelings for a bit. I can have 48 hours to be sad, cry, listen to sad music, kinda be reclusive and introverted, complain to friends and family about it. Then it's time to start healing; I may journal about the topic, meditate, try some breathing techniques, go for a walk, etc. Just to get the feelings out. Healing can take weeks and I may have bad days. But staying in that weepy, I can't function or do anything mood isn't healthy and I have to remember that too. If it's anger, I'll give it up to 24 hours. I can rage, go to the gym or go work out, journal, vent to a friend or family member, etc. I try not to make any major decisions in that time like no major purchases, nothin posted about it on social media, no blocking or unfriending, etc. Allow myself time to cool down and reevaluate how I'm feeling first before I decide to lash out in a permanent way. I may still be upset or frustrated after the 24 hours but then it's time to start working on slowly easing out of those feelings. Sitting in rage for too long puts the body in a fight or flight response which isn't healthy.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608feb3a82989918dae34b7c	00016b18b2--608feb3a82989918dae34b7c	APPROVED
How time consuming it all is. You think if you own your own business, it would equate to you getting a lot of free time since you're your own boss!

I reconcile with the fact that there’s no such thing as wasted potential. When I woke up and realized that my journey was my own I was liberated from the expectations and pressures that had made me struggle for my whole life (even before the mental illness). A great book I’d recommend is the Artist Way by Julia Cameron. I also go to a therapist that has greatly helped me change how I perceive myself and life. You must humanize your journey. Life happens to the best and brightest, the hard times are just as much a part of that story as the others. Please don’t fault yourself ever for taking it slow and doing what you can to survive. After all that’s what humans are made to do, survive. You are not a robot that mindlessly works. And lastly, ask if your surroundings (friends, fam, work) are contributing to these feelings of hopelessness. My friends supported me and my craziest dreams even when they made absolutely no sense lol. They were a huge part of me unlearning a lot of my def destructive habits. I hope none of this sounds harsh.

Nothing to do with gender difference. You’re basically not allowed to question feminism, especially in an intelligent or considered way. That’s especially dangerous, so he had to go.On the other hand, had the guy been telling the pupils how bad men are (which is also saying there is a difference between the sexes), there would have been no problem.So it’s not about the message that men and women are different (which feminism will happily embrace when women are “better” than men), but more he dared encourage “wrongthink” and questioning the message that men are toxic.	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608feb674b93044d506f8436	00016b18b2--608feb674b93044d506f8436	APPROVED

"Been able to read threads here and on r/LeftWingMaleAdvocates to get some info and pointed to new knowledge for me. Been able to see some stuff on YouTube like raw interviews from The Red Pill and such. But when it comes to trying to find something that would be a deeper dive, it gets tough. Tried seeing if I could watch The Red Pill somewhere, but it's behind paywalls. Looked at my library to see what it's got. But my local library has zilch basically. The closest candidate I found for a ""men's rights"" book titled ""Why I'm not a feminist: A feminist manifesto"" but that's not really geared towards men's rights. But there were a nice number of options for feminist material. I might try looking at partner libraries more, but then there's also the question of how to actually access it. Like apparently one of the lending libraries does have web access for The Red Pill but the page I found it via doesn't actually give access. (Go figure.) And it's not like the library in my town is bad. It's actually very nice and well-funded. And there's been other times I get pleasantly surprised at what's available. So it's just a bit frustrating when I'm looking for free materials here (book works better for me than online if I'm going to read a big thing) and can't get anything."	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608feb674b93044d506f8436	00016b18b2--608feb674b93044d506f8436	APPROVED
"I don't see anything wrong with this. This isn't a ""whose the biggest victim"" competition. Women have their issues and we have ours. It's not either-or. This even acknowledges that men have issues too, and uses softer language like ""*most often* against woman"". If anything, it would have been nice to included some stats and info about some mens issues.

I dated a borderline personality disorder feminist, so I can't pull the two apart for what was responsible between those two issues. I was a feminist at the time and let her walk all over me though, which was due to my own issues at the time, I was a bit masochistic and already felt ashamed of being a man and of my masculinity. Luckily it was a long distance relationship so I was protected a lot by that. It was still a huge struggle and I was dehumanized and shamed constantly. I kept telling myself, well she doesn't mean me! I'm a good one! That wasn't actually protecting me from the damage to my self-esteem it created. She would do things like attack me for sending her sexy pics, I think because she had some envy issues or something, I couldn't make sense of it. Eventually it fell apart because I idiotically tried to protect her from some bad influences in her life, and that included a psycho that made up a bunch of horrible things about me once I asserted myself to cut me off from their circle in general. It was very hard on me at the time, but I learned a lot from it in hindsight and it triggered a lot of personal growth.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608febe9dce1aa1bd014df71	00016b18b2--608febe9dce1aa1bd014df71	APPROVED

"It really depends on what you mean by ""porn"".  Sex is an integral part of the human experience and as such subject to artistic interpretation.  So taken in a broader sense as ""depiction of sexual acts"" there is nothing wrong with it provided it does not normalize sexual assault.On the other hand so called ""hardcore"" pornography requires the viewer to understand that the depicted acts are not simulated.  This *is* a problem because it takes away the viewer as a participant in the interpretation of the viewed act and warps the sense of what sex should be to the idea of something that is being done to someone and thus does normalize sexual assault.That is not to say that any depiction of non-simulated sexual acts would be wrong, just that the current hardocre pornography that relies on this fact as its marketing focus is."	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608fec03ae7378653b65f5d7	00016b18b2--608fec03ae7378653b65f5d7	APPROVED

Hey OP, this is great. Also in response to the person calling him a terrorist, as OP said, he has been fighting against subjugation in turkey. A quick google search shows he’s a leftist activist and politician who founded a workers party which made him a threat to the state and an enemy of capitalism who was eventually abducted by Turkish CIA. I am a believer in oppression ultimately coming from the economic need. and I appreciate how he frames women as one of the earliest people oppressed by society as women’s unpaid Labour is so much more valuable than people ever think	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608fec9ba3c96a2638c21f02	00016b18b2--608fec9ba3c96a2638c21f02	APPROVED
"So, I have been called a TERF and a bigot. I think the issue is there is no room for discussion on serious topics. I have always been a trans ally, always felt strongly about equal rights. Here in Ontario, we have self-ID. I was supportive of self-ID, although it was kind of pushed through as law without the public knowing. There is a case here, where a man self-IDd as a woman, and was put in a low security prison.  When he was released, he started identifying as a man again. Here is the issue- while in prison, there were reports of him harassing inmates for sex, hitting on them, Intimidating them - and he sexually assaulted inmates. One has come forward and laid charges against him.  This was a huge eye-opener for me. While I support transwomen, actual transwomen, some laws started with good intentions are being abused - by MEN. It gives transwomen a bad rep.  When I try to discuss this very serious issue, I am shut down being called a bigot and TERF. Blocked before anyone will listen.  There needs to be reform with this law to protect women from predatory men.I get so upset, that female victims are being silenced on this issue, and so called feminist disregard these victims in  place of virtu-signally.It upsets me, that our media is keeping this case quiet - there is a narrative and nothing can question it.As feminist, we should be able to discuss all issues women face, without being bullied into silence.  Transwomen should be listening imo, bc these men are going to destroy all the work for equality that older transpeople have fought hard for. Having the public finally understand the pain of dysphoria, just to have sick men use their rights for their own sick, twisted ways.  None of our msm will report this case. This happened at a prison near me, and have spoken with other women who were housed with this man, and heard their experiences. All I have asked was for a discussion to find a compromise that keeps both transwomen and cis women safe from predatory men, and that makes me a.bigot apparently.  Anyone who does discuss it, basically says ""well its rare, shit happens"". What was the point of the  meetoo movement if we are to jjst suck it up and accept women will get raped?  Here is a link.  FYI, the term rape is not used in canada. We use ""sexual assault"" to various degrees.

What you are experiencing is really common, especially at your age. I’m a 24 year old male pursuing a doctoral degree in healthcare, and during my education I’ve taken feminist theory, philosophy of sex and love, psychology of interpersonal dynamics, and some other classes on administration. In addition, throughout my college experience I’ve had met people that are in relationships that are harmful to them, people that are victims of abuse, and been in bad relationships myself. Some of these people I’ve met are by best friends now, but it took years to build trust or enable them to change their mindset to one that is healthy enough to be independent. The perspective I’ve gotten from that experience has shown me a few things that can help you navigate what you are talking about. The most helpful thing is to model positive relationships. When a person has an abuser (this could even mean an unhealthy relationship, including those that enable patriarchal behavior) in their life, they need a support system because they are victims. We need to show them kindness, allow them to talk about their problems, and let them know we love them exactly as they are. People do not respond well to being told what to do, even when we view the solution (such as breaking up) to be clear. When we tell a distressed person what to do or think, we model the same behavior that the abuser is using. “It’s normal for men to see strippers and you are a prude for not letting me” is along the same line as “you should break up with him because he is wrong and hurting you”, even if I agree with the latter statement much more. By using terms like “if he is breaking the boundaries of your relationship, what do you think is a way to clarify to him that you need different things” and “you are not “that girl”, I think you are wonderful and everything you’re saying makes sense. I’m going to be here for you no matter what you decide to do, and will help you through it” are much more empowering statements that encourage communication and problem solving, while also demonstrating care and respect. I’ve found you can never tell someone to break up with their partner, but you can demonstrate that there is better love out there, and make them feel supported enough to make the jump of ending a relationship (which is REALLY scary because no one likes to feel alone). Over time, the person feels enough support to be able to make that life change because they have you. It takes time, but by being there for people and loving them you are doing good. Eventually, people do ask about what I believe, why I have been there for them, and when those questions come out a real foundation of meaningful friendship can be made. Sometimes people continue to choose unhealthy men that can’t communicate or understand that relationships mean caring for another’s happiness, even if it means not going to strip clubs (these are the immature ones). Learning open and two way communication is really hard, especially when you’re 18. But you’re learning it, and it’s a wonderful process that will create meaningful and  lasting relationships. Being there for people has been my way of finding meaning in my life, and I hope you can help your friends move on to better men that listen, care, and work toward mutual happiness and love.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608fec9ba3c96a2638c21f02	00016b18b2--608fec9ba3c96a2638c21f02	APPROVED

This woman, unattractive as she is, with very little English and not much else to distinguish her, is seeking the IMPOSSIBLY PERFECT husband, and she has left China to the USA to find him.  Her name is Luo Yufeng, or Fengjie, and she is a Chinese internet celebrity who left Shanghai in 2010 for America on a quest for a husband who meets her exacting standards.  He must have graduated from Yale or Harvard, or similar, have ambitions of world domination, cannot be Asian and preferably stands at 2m tall.  Yes, you read correct. he cannot be Asian. Why? I don't know but this is not the first Chinese woman I have heard who has made that kind of statement.  Fengjie, 27, stands at just 1.3m but points out that she wears heels.

Including pornography as ‘anti-feminist’ has always seemed like a huge reach to me. Consider how much stuff the umbrella term ‘porn’ actually refers to...

I don’t think you’re an asshole but the situation embarrassed her.  I can see it making you uncomfortable but women don’t want to wear bras anymore or at least not all the time and I think her not wearing one in front of you was a sign that she was comfortable around you and now she’s probably not.  You were the one uncomfortable though so a hotel shouldn’t be an offensive thing for you - she is being kind by not making you uncomfortable about her breasts.  She shouldn’t have to change her lifestyle in her own house because of how it makes you feel.  Not trying to be mean to you here either but she basically just gave you the courtesy of a “heads up” that her breasts will be braless at her house and since that offends you she will see you but you’ll have to stay elsewhere so YOU aren’t offended.

"It really depends on what you mean by ""porn"".  Sex is an integral part of the human experience and as such subject to artistic interpretation.  So taken in a broader sense as ""depiction of sexual acts"" there is nothing wrong with it provided it does not normalize sexual assault.On the other hand so called ""hardcore"" pornography requires the viewer to understand that the depicted acts are not simulated.  This *is* a problem because it takes away the viewer as a participant in the interpretation of the viewed act and warps the sense of what sex should be to the idea of something that is being done to someone and thus does normalize sexual assault.That is not to say that any depiction of non-simulated sexual acts would be wrong, just that the current hardocre pornography that relies on this fact as its marketing focus is."	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608fedfa2b838e47813c5e86	00016b18b2--608fedfa2b838e47813c5e86	APPROVED

Her death is tragic, goes without saying, murders are tragic. Why do people find it necessary to express this with the additional attack on men? I've seen so many people on Reddit, in the media, and other social media platforms, go from: woman was kidnapped and murdered to all men are dangerous/ teach men not to....... / yes all men/ and now: the police are sexist. I just can't get my head around it and I feel so alone in my opinions I'm starting to lose the plot a bit. And when I see seemingly pleasant posts paying respect for her with that dig at men attached, all I feel is that whoever shared it is virtue signalling and totally insincere.Whenever I see people mention how many men kill women, about sexism in the police, I want to explain that more men are victims of violence from strangers, and that the criminal system is hugely skewered in favour of women, not against them. Not that sentencing is the same as policing but you get my point. I don't comment this stuff out of respect for the lady who was killed, but these narratives are being perpetuated so much, at least in the UK.Why is it okay for men to be vilified in such broad terms and it be the popular opinion?	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608fee0182989918dae380a7	00016b18b2--608fee0182989918dae380a7	APPROVED

"Logically, you can group the issues of both men and women into the following categories:\- Fairness of the written law\- Fairness of the applied law\- Societal fairness\- Fairness of the money spent by the government\- Fairness of the media/entertrainment industries portrayal of a certain sex\- Fairness in educationThere are probably more categories, but the list is good enough for a post here.Now, I don't specifically advocate for equality, I advocate for fairness. Equality is just a special case of fairness, and I'm totally fine with implementing equality.However, the most fundamental equality is the equality in the written and applied law.But in (almost?) all western countries, women do have clear legal advantages both in the written and the applied law.Often, people argue that this is needed to compensate for other inequalities, and I think this is a cheap excuse.In my country, womens retirement age is lower than mens. The reason this is the case is, because in the past, women were usually younger then men when they married, so for both sexes to statistically retire at the same time, women just got gifted a few years more retirement.Military is another obvious example, where men are legally forced to partake in military service (or pay a compensation fine) and women get a free pass. Often people respons with ""then we should abolish the army, or make it voluntary"". Imho, that's cherrypicking. IF you support equality AND you are against mandatory military service, you should support military service for women if there is the abolishment of the mandatory military service is not going to happen. You can then still advocate for abolishment of the military service.And that's only a tiny bit of the inequality in the written law.The next thing is the application of the law.As far as I know, and correct me if I am wrong, men get harder sentences for the same crimes.For example female pedophiles regularly get a slap on the wrist, because ""the 13 year old boy should be glad that he had sex with a hot teacher"" or something along the lines.Funny enough, both men and women judge women more lightly according to studies I've read (but again, I could be wrong), so as long as there is a human factor, the disadvantage of men in the application of the law will never fully vanish.That's why, I would love to have a judicial system that basically determines the sentence for a certain crime statically and only let judges decise in previously unknown edge cases.I skip societal fairness, because that's way to complicated of a topic, I think you could write books about it. But also societal fairness is basically made by society, which means it's democratic, it changes if we change, and forced changes will never work, only ever backfire.So let's get to an easier topic, tax money spent on a certain sex.I don't want perfect 50/50 split here, because men and women are biologically different, which must be reflected in the money spent for health care.But when men pay twice the amount of taxes in their lifetimes (that's a guess, I don't know the exact number, but it's afaik a big difference), but get half the amount of money, because they both work longer and die earlier, it's kind of unfair to a level nobody who seeks equality can support.There's many things like that, and one important example is that governments support academic feminism, which is not scientific but a lobbying group for feminist interests. There's nothing generally wrong with grassroot lobbying for your own interests, but it's criminally corrupt when you get tax dollars for it.And then there is the media/entertainment industries portrayal of men and women.Let's for example look at the female ghost busters movie. The assistent is not only a man, but he's absolutely stupid. Is that how feminists perceived the female secretary in ghost busters? I don't think so, because she was smart and strong.Truth is, men get portrayed as stupid idiots that can't do anything right until women do it for them very often. This is NEVER EVER the case for women.But I also dislike the portrayal of women in the media. For policital reasons they are sometimes portrayed as so extremely great, that the plot makes no sense anymore, because everybody else becomes just useless and insignificant. They become totally characterless. You can't even enjoy movies anymore like this. This was the case in star wars. The consequence of this is not even in favour of women, because the viewers, both men and women, get annoyed and start to be sceptical of moview with female leads.Also there was never a reason for it. We had great female leads for decades and everbody liked it. Take Kill Bill, Alien, Mulan, Star Gate and many others as examples. They were not woke, they were just women with character who filled their role to make their movies/series better.And that was only about the entertainment industry, the media isn't exactly neutral too.Ant the education is another hot topic.For decades we were trying to encourage women, because they were less educated for historical reasons that they didn't cause.And now, men are less educated. What are we doing as a reaction? Still encouraging women and downplaying the issues of men... how that makes any sense to anyone escapes me.And we know for decades how you could easily improve mens performance. Competition, Cooperation, Gamification and more physical movement in between.So why don't we do it? I don't know. It wouldn't even cost much."	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608fee0182989918dae380a7	00016b18b2--608fee0182989918dae380a7	APPROVED

Yes. We were close friends, had similar interests were nearly perfect for each other. But there was no chemistry whatsoever. We had been friends for years, he had always wanted more and at some point I felt something. And acted on it. And realised it wasn't enough. And dumped him. And felt horrible for years until we found each other on FB and I saw his pics with his beautiful wife, with whom he shares his passion and with whom he's definitely happy. I do not share his passion so I'm extra happy for him. And also, he used to be really insecure about his looks, he's the funny-cute type,but not conventionally handsome. And when we were just friends I kept telling him that he was going to have a hot wife. And guess what. His wife is really beautiful, there's warmth coming from her and he looks happy.

Including pornography as ‘anti-feminist’ has always seemed like a huge reach to me. Consider how much stuff the umbrella term ‘porn’ actually refers to... It’s everything that can get you off, and by you I mean men and women and all the others of every possible sexuality and kink (and those who have none at all) from every corner of the world. Are you seriously, and sincerely saying that all of what porn is, and could be, contributes to human trafficking?

I don’t think you’re an asshole but the situation embarrassed her.  I can see it making you uncomfortable but women don’t want to wear bras anymore or at least not all the time and I think her not wearing one in front of you was a sign that she was comfortable around you and now she’s probably not.  You were the one uncomfortable though so a hotel shouldn’t be an offensive thing for you - she is being kind by not making you uncomfortable about her breasts.  She shouldn’t have to change her lifestyle in her own house because of how it makes you feel.  Not trying to be mean to you here either but she basically just gave you the courtesy of a “heads up” that her breasts will be braless at her house and since that offends you she will see you but you’ll have to stay elsewhere so YOU aren’t offended.  It sounds pretty fair to me.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608fee6b5205fe726585cf38	00016b18b2--608fee6b5205fe726585cf38	APPROVED

Her death is tragic, goes without saying, murders are tragic. Why do people find it necessary to express this with the additional attack on men? I've seen so many people on Reddit, in the media, and other social media platforms, go from: woman was kidnapped and murdered to all men are dangerous/ teach men not to....... / yes all men/ and now: the police are sexist. I just can't get my head around it and I feel so alone in my opinions I'm starting to lose the plot a bit. And when I see seemingly pleasant posts paying respect for her with that dig at men attached, all I feel is that whoever shared it is virtue signalling and totally insincere.Whenever I see people mention how many men kill women, about sexism in the police, I want to explain that more men are victims of violence from strangers, and that the criminal system is hugely skewered in favour of women, not against them. Not that sentencing is the same as policing but you get my point. I don't comment this stuff out of respect for the lady who was killed, but these narratives are being perpetuated so much, at least in the UK.Why is it okay for men to be vilified in such broad terms and it be the popular opinion?	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608fef182d4a1e497ad51a6b	00016b18b2--608fef182d4a1e497ad51a6b	APPROVED

"Logically, you can group the issues of both men and women into the following categories:\- Fairness of the written law\- Fairness of the applied law\- Societal fairness\- Fairness of the money spent by the government\- Fairness of the media/entertrainment industries portrayal of a certain sex\- Fairness in educationThere are probably more categories, but the list is good enough for a post here.Now, I don't specifically advocate for equality, I advocate for fairness. Equality is just a special case of fairness, and I'm totally fine with implementing equality.However, the most fundamental equality is the equality in the written and applied law.But in (almost?) all western countries, women do have clear legal advantages both in the written and the applied law.Often, people argue that this is needed to compensate for other inequalities, and I think this is a cheap excuse.In my country, womens retirement age is lower than mens. The reason this is the case is, because in the past, women were usually younger then men when they married, so for both sexes to statistically retire at the same time, women just got gifted a few years more retirement.Military is another obvious example, where men are legally forced to partake in military service (or pay a compensation fine) and women get a free pass. Often people respons with ""then we should abolish the army, or make it voluntary"". Imho, that's cherrypicking. IF you support equality AND you are against mandatory military service, you should support military service for women if there is the abolishment of the mandatory military service is not going to happen. You can then still advocate for abolishment of the military service.And that's only a tiny bit of the inequality in the written law.The next thing is the application of the law.As far as I know, and correct me if I am wrong, men get harder sentences for the same crimes.For example female pedophiles regularly get a slap on the wrist, because ""the 13 year old boy should be glad that he had sex with a hot teacher"" or something along the lines.Funny enough, both men and women judge women more lightly according to studies I've read (but again, I could be wrong), so as long as there is a human factor, the disadvantage of men in the application of the law will never fully vanish.That's why, I would love to have a judicial system that basically determines the sentence for a certain crime statically and only let judges decise in previously unknown edge cases.I skip societal fairness, because that's way to complicated of a topic, I think you could write books about it. But also societal fairness is basically made by society, which means it's democratic, it changes if we change, and forced changes will never work, only ever backfire.So let's get to an easier topic, tax money spent on a certain sex.I don't want perfect 50/50 split here, because men and women are biologically different, which must be reflected in the money spent for health care.But when men pay twice the amount of taxes in their lifetimes (that's a guess, I don't know the exact number, but it's afaik a big difference), but get half the amount of money, because they both work longer and die earlier, it's kind of unfair to a level nobody who seeks equality can support.There's many things like that, and one important example is that governments support academic feminism, which is not scientific but a lobbying group for feminist interests. There's nothing generally wrong with grassroot lobbying for your own interests, but it's criminally corrupt when you get tax dollars for it.And then there is the media/entertainment industries portrayal of men and women.Let's for example look at the female ghost busters movie. The assistent is not only a man, but he's absolutely stupid. Is that how feminists perceived the female secretary in ghost busters? I don't think so, because she was smart and strong.Truth is, men get portrayed as stupid idiots that can't do anything right until women do it for them very often. This is NEVER EVER the case for women.But I also dislike the portrayal of women in the media. For policital reasons they are sometimes portrayed as so extremely great, that the plot makes no sense anymore, because everybody else becomes just useless and insignificant. They become totally characterless. You can't even enjoy movies anymore like this. This was the case in star wars. The consequence of this is not even in favour of women, because the viewers, both men and women, get annoyed and start to be sceptical of moview with female leads.Also there was never a reason for it. We had great female leads for decades and everbody liked it. Take Kill Bill, Alien, Mulan, Star Gate and many others as examples. They were not woke, they were just women with character who filled their role to make their movies/series better.And that was only about the entertainment industry, the media isn't exactly neutral too.Ant the education is another hot topic.For decades we were trying to encourage women, because they were less educated for historical reasons that they didn't cause.And now, men are less educated. What are we doing as a reaction? Still encouraging women and downplaying the issues of men... how that makes any sense to anyone escapes me.And we know for decades how you could easily improve mens performance. Competition, Cooperation, Gamification and more physical movement in between.So why don't we do it? I don't know. It wouldn't even cost much."	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608fef182d4a1e497ad51a6b	00016b18b2--608fef182d4a1e497ad51a6b	APPROVED

> That woman: Starts a protest and new wave of feminism.I dislike that it is reality. Body positivism as an idea isn't necessarily a bad one, but holy crap is it a sexist, corrupt movement. Craps all over women who actually decide to lose weight too.While it might be mostly women, but an awful lot of people these days don't seem to be very introspective. So props to your girlfriend for actually having a growth moment, but shes very much the minority unfortunately.One thing studying psychology taught me is how biases work and its been very...self enlightening to think about my own. I'm not perfect, but i can do pretty well at separating my subjective view and the objective(if possible) view. The one issue i have is i am quite righteous, because i try my best to align with objective truths and sometimes the 'i am right' view just pops out.For me, i'm not into that fat lady, i wouldn't call her specifically, ugly, but her arms definitely are. I have a huge thing about flabby arms.	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608ff05338e2f73c3f1b9e14	00016b18b2--608ff05338e2f73c3f1b9e14	APPROVED
The law ratio (laws lobbied for by feminists for women and for men) and growing bias towards men shows the original motives of the 1st wave. Since people didn’t have stats and surveys to see the downsides of being men, they meant by equality to move up and be equal that way because they saw the obvious fact they were put below men. therefore, they mean “get better laws to be on par with men” rather then “make men and women equal in all ways” which explains why they act the way they act and why it doesn’t seem to live up with the latter defention. They didn’t know how bad it was.

I don't wear a bra in those cases. Strapless bras are just super uncomfortable for me and I think they fit worse than if I didn't wear a bra at all. I'm a 32E for reference. I don't take any special measures to make sure my breasts aren't shaking everywhere, they're just breasts and if I've taken the decision to wear a strappy dress then I'm accepting there's going to be some movement there - shock horror!

Sorry that no one has responded. Anyway, I think it's problematic for a few reasons.1. It has a strange implication that women aren't capable of providing for themselves, so they are apparently entitled to a constant payment from their ex husbands.2. I think it is designed to further discourage divorce because our culture deems divorce scummy for some reason, even though the majority of marriages fail.3. I personally just flat out think it's unreasonable. I think the breadwinner of whatever relationship should pay a reasonable amount of money to their ex partner, giving the person enough time to get on their feet, financially. They should be legally compelled to find work that pays a living wage or else the payments will continuously get smaller and smaller. After the person gets back on their feet, the breadwinner is freed from these obligations.This last point may sound silly, but the amount of divorced women who re-marry and yet still receive alimony from their previous husbands is asinine.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608ff06c42e18f6d7202e109	00016b18b2--608ff06c42e18f6d7202e109	APPROVED
I think it depends how old the customer is to be honest. Men sexualizing women is a huge problem; especially when the women are younger than the men. But I don’t feel like men have the same problem with women sexualizing them when they’re younger. Obviously, there are exceptions. Men can be harassed, too. But if they were clearly younger than you and you weren’t flirting with a minor or anything it seems to be okay. Then again, I’m not an expert. 	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608ff06c42e18f6d7202e109	00016b18b2--608ff06c42e18f6d7202e109	APPROVED

You don't have a right to retaliate, that would be vigilantism. If attacked, you have the right for self-defense, and for that, you can use force appropriate to the danger. You also have the right to call the police/report it to the policy afterward, because it is a crime to physically attack someone. This is true regardless of gender. The problem might arise from how to interpret 'force appropriate to the danger'. It is generally assumed that women are weaker thus they can't represent a real danger to men, thus men using physical force is never appropriate to the danger a woman can pose to them, but that is a very harmful thinking based on gender stereotypes. Women can and in some cases do pose a threat to men, and if you are in that situation you have the right to defend yourself as good as you can, and if it's necessary, you can use force for that. That is the same if you are attacked by another man. You can't just retaliate and go and kill him. You can defend yourself, and cause physical harm appropriate to the threat.	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608ff06c42e18f6d7202e109	00016b18b2--608ff06c42e18f6d7202e109	APPROVED

Yes. We were close friends, had similar interests were nearly perfect for each other. But there was no chemistry whatsoever. We had been friends for years, he had always wanted more and at some point I felt something. And acted on it. And realised it wasn't enough. And dumped him. And felt horrible for years until we found each other on FB and I saw his pics with his beautiful wife, with whom he shares his passion and with whom he's definitely happy. I do not share his passion so I'm extra happy for him. And also, he used to be really insecure about his looks, he's the funny-cute type,but not conventionally handsome. And when we were just friends I kept telling him that he was going to have a hot wife. And guess what. His wife is really beautiful, there's warmth coming from her and he looks happy.

Including pornography as ‘anti-feminist’ has always seemed like a huge reach to me. Consider how much stuff the umbrella term ‘porn’ actually refers to... It’s everything that can get you off, and by you I mean men and women and all the others of every possible sexuality and kink (and those who have none at all) from every corner of the world.

I don’t think you’re an asshole but the situation embarrassed her.  I can see it making you uncomfortable but women don’t want to wear bras anymore or at least not all the time and I think her not wearing one in front of you was a sign that she was comfortable around you and now she’s probably not.  You were the one uncomfortable though so a hotel shouldn’t be an offensive thing for you - she is being kind by not making you uncomfortable about her breasts.  She shouldn’t have to change her lifestyle in her own house because of how it makes you feel.  Not trying to be mean to you here either but she basically just gave you the courtesy of a “heads up” that her breasts will be braless at her house and since that offends you she will see you but you’ll have to stay elsewhere so YOU aren’t offended.

Hey OP, this is great. Also in response to the person calling him a terrorist, as OP said, he has been fighting against subjugation in turkey. A quick google search shows he’s a leftist activist and politician who founded a workers party which made him a threat to the state and an enemy of capitalism who was eventually abducted by Turkish CIA. I am a believer in oppression ultimately coming from the economic need. and I appreciate how he frames women as one of the earliest people oppressed by society as women’s unpaid Labour is so much more valuable than people ever think	1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608ff0e96fb3ed62c92802c4	00016b18b2--608ff0e96fb3ed62c92802c4	APPROVED
"So, I have been called a TERF and a bigot. I think the issue is there is no room for discussion on serious topics. I have always been a trans ally, always felt strongly about equal rights. Here in Ontario, we have self-ID. I was supportive of self-ID, although it was kind of pushed through as law without the public knowing. There is a case here, where a man self-IDd as a woman, and was put in a low security prison.  When he was released, he started identifying as a man again. Here is the issue- while in prison, there were reports of him harassing inmates for sex, hitting on them, Intimidating them - and he sexually assaulted inmates. One has come forward and laid charges against him.  This was a huge eye-opener for me. While I support transwomen, actual transwomen, some laws started with good intentions are being abused - by MEN. It gives transwomen a bad rep.  When I try to discuss this very serious issue, I am shut down being called a bigot and TERF. Blocked before anyone will listen.  There needs to be reform with this law to protect women from predatory men.I get so upset, that female victims are being silenced on this issue, and so called feminist disregard these victims in  place of virtu-signally.It upsets me, that our media is keeping this case quiet - there is a narrative and nothing can question it.As feminist, we should be able to discuss all issues women face, without being bullied into silence.  Transwomen should be listening imo, bc these men are going to destroy all the work for equality that older transpeople have fought hard for. Having the public finally understand the pain of dysphoria, just to have sick men use their rights for their own sick, twisted ways.  None of our msm will report this case. This happened at a prison near me, and have spoken with other women who were housed with this man, and heard their experiences. All I have asked was for a discussion to find a compromise that keeps both transwomen and cis women safe from predatory men, and that makes me a.bigot apparently.  Anyone who does discuss it, basically says ""well its rare, shit happens"". What was the point of the  meetoo movement if we are to jjst suck it up and accept women will get raped?  Here is a link.  FYI, the term rape is not used in canada. We use ""sexual assault"" to various degrees.

What you are experiencing is really common, especially at your age. I’m a 24 year old male pursuing a doctoral degree in healthcare, and during my education I’ve taken feminist theory, philosophy of sex and love, psychology of interpersonal dynamics, and some other classes on administration. In addition, throughout my college experience I’ve had met people that are in relationships that are harmful to them, people that are victims of abuse, and been in bad relationships myself. Some of these people I’ve met are by best friends now, but it took years to build trust or enable them to change their mindset to one that is healthy enough to be independent. The perspective I’ve gotten from that experience has shown me a few things that can help you navigate what you are talking about. The most helpful thing is to model positive relationships. When a person has an abuser (this could even mean an unhealthy relationship, including those that enable patriarchal behavior) in their life, they need a support system because they are victims. We need to show them kindness, allow them to talk about their problems, and let them know we love them exactly as they are. People do not respond well to being told what to do, even when we view the solution (such as breaking up) to be clear. When we tell a distressed person what to do or think, we model the same behavior that the abuser is using. “It’s normal for men to see strippers and you are a prude for not letting me” is along the same line as “you should break up with him because he is wrong and hurting you”, even if I agree with the latter statement much more. By using terms like “if he is breaking the boundaries of your relationship, what do you think is a way to clarify to him that you need different things” and “you are not “that girl”, I think you are wonderful and everything you’re saying makes sense. I’m going to be here for you no matter what you decide to do, and will help you through it” are much more empowering statements that encourage communication and problem solving, while also demonstrating care and respect. I’ve found you can never tell someone to break up with their partner, but you can demonstrate that there is better love out there, and make them feel supported enough to make the jump of ending a relationship (which is REALLY scary because no one likes to feel alone). Over time, the person feels enough support to be able to make that life change because they have you. It takes time, but by being there for people and loving them you are doing good. Eventually, people do ask about what I believe, why I have been there for them, and when those questions come out a real foundation of meaningful friendship can be made. Sometimes people continue to choose unhealthy men that can’t communicate or understand that relationships mean caring for another’s happiness, even if it means not going to strip clubs (these are the immature ones). Learning open and two way communication is really hard, especially when you’re 18. But you’re learning it, and it’s a wonderful process that will create meaningful and  lasting relationships. Being there for people has been my way of finding meaning in my life, and I hope you can help your friends move on to better men that listen, care, and work toward mutual happiness and love.	1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608ff0e96fb3ed62c92802c4	00016b18b2--608ff0e96fb3ed62c92802c4	APPROVED

Her death is tragic, goes without saying, murders are tragic. Why do people find it necessary to express this with the additional attack on men? I've seen so many people on Reddit, in the media, and other social media platforms, go from: woman was kidnapped and murdered to all men are dangerous/ teach men not to....... / yes all men/ and now: the police are sexist. I just can't get my head around it and I feel so alone in my opinions I'm starting to lose the plot a bit. And when I see seemingly pleasant posts paying respect for her with that dig at men attached, all I feel is that whoever shared it is virtue signalling and totally insincere.Whenever I see people mention how many men kill women, about sexism in the police, I want to explain that more men are victims of violence from strangers, and that the criminal system is hugely skewered in favour of women, not against them. Not that sentencing is the same as policing but you get my point. I don't comment this stuff out of respect for the lady who was killed, but these narratives are being perpetuated so much, at least in the UK.Why is it okay for men to be vilified in such broad terms and it be the popular opinion?	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608ff19e6fb3ed62c9280f9a	00016b18b2--608ff19e6fb3ed62c9280f9a	APPROVED

"Logically, you can group the issues of both men and women into the following categories:\- Fairness of the written law\- Fairness of the applied law\- Societal fairness\- Fairness of the money spent by the government\- Fairness of the media/entertrainment industries portrayal of a certain sex\- Fairness in educationThere are probably more categories, but the list is good enough for a post here.Now, I don't specifically advocate for equality, I advocate for fairness. Equality is just a special case of fairness, and I'm totally fine with implementing equality.However, the most fundamental equality is the equality in the written and applied law.But in (almost?) all western countries, women do have clear legal advantages both in the written and the applied law.Often, people argue that this is needed to compensate for other inequalities, and I think this is a cheap excuse.In my country, womens retirement age is lower than mens. The reason this is the case is, because in the past, women were usually younger then men when they married, so for both sexes to statistically retire at the same time, women just got gifted a few years more retirement.Military is another obvious example, where men are legally forced to partake in military service (or pay a compensation fine) and women get a free pass. Often people respons with ""then we should abolish the army, or make it voluntary"". Imho, that's cherrypicking. IF you support equality AND you are against mandatory military service, you should support military service for women if there is the abolishment of the mandatory military service is not going to happen. You can then still advocate for abolishment of the military service.And that's only a tiny bit of the inequality in the written law.The next thing is the application of the law.As far as I know, and correct me if I am wrong, men get harder sentences for the same crimes.For example female pedophiles regularly get a slap on the wrist, because ""the 13 year old boy should be glad that he had sex with a hot teacher"" or something along the lines.Funny enough, both men and women judge women more lightly according to studies I've read (but again, I could be wrong), so as long as there is a human factor, the disadvantage of men in the application of the law will never fully vanish.That's why, I would love to have a judicial system that basically determines the sentence for a certain crime statically and only let judges decise in previously unknown edge cases.I skip societal fairness, because that's way to complicated of a topic, I think you could write books about it. But also societal fairness is basically made by society, which means it's democratic, it changes if we change, and forced changes will never work, only ever backfire.So let's get to an easier topic, tax money spent on a certain sex.I don't want perfect 50/50 split here, because men and women are biologically different, which must be reflected in the money spent for health care.But when men pay twice the amount of taxes in their lifetimes (that's a guess, I don't know the exact number, but it's afaik a big difference), but get half the amount of money, because they both work longer and die earlier, it's kind of unfair to a level nobody who seeks equality can support.There's many things like that, and one important example is that governments support academic feminism, which is not scientific but a lobbying group for feminist interests. There's nothing generally wrong with grassroot lobbying for your own interests, but it's criminally corrupt when you get tax dollars for it.And then there is the media/entertainment industries portrayal of men and women.Let's for example look at the female ghost busters movie. The assistent is not only a man, but he's absolutely stupid. Is that how feminists perceived the female secretary in ghost busters? I don't think so, because she was smart and strong.Truth is, men get portrayed as stupid idiots that can't do anything right until women do it for them very often. This is NEVER EVER the case for women.But I also dislike the portrayal of women in the media. For policital reasons they are sometimes portrayed as so extremely great, that the plot makes no sense anymore, because everybody else becomes just useless and insignificant. They become totally characterless. You can't even enjoy movies anymore like this. This was the case in star wars. The consequence of this is not even in favour of women, because the viewers, both men and women, get annoyed and start to be sceptical of moview with female leads.Also there was never a reason for it. We had great female leads for decades and everbody liked it. Take Kill Bill, Alien, Mulan, Star Gate and many others as examples. They were not woke, they were just women with character who filled their role to make their movies/series better.And that was only about the entertainment industry, the media isn't exactly neutral too.Ant the education is another hot topic.For decades we were trying to encourage women, because they were less educated for historical reasons that they didn't cause.And now, men are less educated. What are we doing as a reaction? Still encouraging women and downplaying the issues of men... how that makes any sense to anyone escapes me.And we know for decades how you could easily improve mens performance. Competition, Cooperation, Gamification and more physical movement in between.So why don't we do it? I don't know. It wouldn't even cost much."	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608ff19e6fb3ed62c9280f9a	00016b18b2--608ff19e6fb3ed62c9280f9a	APPROVED

If you have any intuitive people (or animals!) in your life I would go room to room trying to find its ""nest"", or just the densest gathering of its energy so you can focus your intentions.

I've seen some arguments that the voynich manuscript doesn't seem like an actual language and it does seem convincing. There are of course languages which we can't decipher like linear-a apparently. But the voynich manuscript seems to consist of mainly very few letters. There's one letter that appears in almost every word and sometimes three times in a row. Overall apparently the text mostly consists of just few letters, and there are many that are barely used. Of course it's possible it is a very different kind of language from any european languages which could help explain the odd abundance of certain characters, but apparently many think the text is actually gibberish	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608ff254a3c96a2638c2aa89	00016b18b2--608ff254a3c96a2638c2aa89	APPROVED

maybe this is an unpopular opinion in feminism, but I really dislike the whole 'onlyfans' and sexualised nudity on social media... which women claim is 'empowering'. I get to some people might feel temporarily 'empowered' to choose when to show off their body but what they are ultimately doing is objectifying themselves for the visual pleasure of others. They are doing it for the likes, for the attention and for the praise and with only fans - for the money. Is something that is done entirely for the public praise of doing it ever truly 'empowering'? I don’t buy that its done for the individual posting it - because why post to a public forum.. just BE naked or pose sexy, on your own if it is just for you. I think maybe we have gotten caught up in an idea that anything women do is inherently okay because 'feminism' and to raise a point against it is somehow anti-feminist. I think onlyfans and sexual provocation/nudity on social media devalues the female form, the brain of the woman, the achievements of the woman. And not just the women in question it devalues either so I think it goes beyond 'personal choice' but it also perpetuates that mentality of objectification... that women should be attractive and sexy and alluring etc etc etc I think it just flies in the face of everything feminists have tried to achieve for the female sex. You don’t see top CEOs or high achieving men like Elon Musk, Jordan Peterson, Joe Rogan slapping their balls on Instagram and say it makes them feel good about themselves (for this to make sense you also have to imagine a world run my women who constantly objectify men’s balls - and use them to sell almost everything to the masses). Now, I’m not a prude, I have my insecurities but I am pretty much always naked at home and I don’t entirely mind if someone outside sees me, I’m not trying to be seen but I’m pretty comfortable being naked at home, I’d skinny dip in a heart beat, ive had naked drunken baths with friends and I love nudist beaches so this opinion isn’t coming from the perspective of someone who is necessarily just skin shy. I was, however, abused as a child. Possibly from before the age of 4, a time which I have no memory of. and I can’t help but think that the oversexualisation of women is a key factor in men treating women in the disgusting ways that they sometimes do. It is because they do not see them as equal, in cognitive or social or physical ability and I think when we push our tits together in a forever21 tank top with an arched back and a bit of side bum showing with some cheap ass caption of ''feel like an empowered woman, hbu?' it makes a f\*\*\*\*\*\* mockery of actual empowered women striving to make a big difference in this world and cutting through the corporate male dominated world where men’s heads are swimming with this kind of lurid imagery every time we give a presentation, host an event or lead on a business deal. Just do us all a favour and stop it.

"What is the argument here? That men are dropping out of society? What does ""dropping out of society"" mean? Who exactly are the men who are ""dropping out of society""? It seems that according to the author dropping out of society means not paying taxes/paying fewer taxes because they say that >if men start ""dropping out"" of society in large numbers, tax revenues will decline. We don't know what men the author talks about, and because of that, we can't decide if this claim is true or not. In the US, the employment rate is increasing since 2012, both for men and for women and slightly more for men (Source: OECD). So this data contradicts the claim that men are dropping out of society in the sense that they are dropping out of the labor market. It is surely true for some segment of men, and it would be useful to talk about them, but this argument is so generalizing that it doesn't support constructive discussion on the matter. And at this generalized level, this claim is not even true (it is not true in the EU either, I don't know about other countries). The author gives two reasons for men dropping out of the labor market. One is the loss in economic opportunities leading to the middle class, the other is the changes in the institution of marriage. For the first, they say, that>many of the roads that led to the middle class have been closed. Entire industries have been crated up and shipped overseas. They say that because entire industries relocated overseas, many of the economic opportunities to maintain a middle-class life disappeared, which caused a decline in male employment. It may be a case in certain areas, but not at others. To decide if it is true or not, we should have an exact context. Again, this claim is just too generalized to spur a fruitful discussion. The second reason is that > marriage has been gutted to the point that a spouse can be better described as ""a roommate you have to pay a fortune to have evicted."" What? You don't have to marry if you don't want and what is the relationship between marriage and losing jobs? The argument seems to imply that men losing jobs because they have to pay in case of divorce. I can't comprehend this argument. Divorce laws may be bad, even biased against men, but how does it affect the employment status? Then the argument goes on to suggest areas to consider regarding this decline. The first is that > The overwhelming majority of government revenue is *collected from* men. This is just not true. In the US, 66.3% of men and 54.5% of women were working in 2018 - they all paid taxes. More men work, but it's not an overwhelming majority. In the EU, 54% of all working people were men and 46% were women. This doesn't seem like an ""overwhelming majority"". (Source: Eurostat)The second area to consider is that> The overwhelming majority of government benefits are *collected by* women. The overwhelming majority are collected by families and children. It is sad that mostly mothers have custody of children, so they get to get the money given to the children. It depends on the country and state of course, but please let me know benefits only available to women and is not related to children (I don't live in the US, so there might be). And the third is that> The overwhelming majority of consumer spending is *controlled by* women. What do you mean by ""controlled""? How do you measure it? It is a claim that is impossible to prove or disprove because of its vagueness. After stating that men are dropping out of society (which is not true at US level) and presenting three ""facts"" from which one is definitely not true, one is most likely not true but I could not find statistics on it, and one cannot be answered because of how it is phrased. And from these flawed facts, the argument concludes that social problems will arise. > if men start ""dropping out"" of society in large numbers, tax revenues will decline, entitlements will be cut, and consumer spending will fall. Also, birth rates will fall further, and given that our retirement programs rely on a large number of the young supporting the old, you have a recipe for trouble. The logic here might actually be true. So in a case when men start dropping out of the labor market, tax revenues will most likely decline. Because of that, entitlements may be cut in the long run. If there will be more unemployed men and also fewer entitlements, consumer spending would also fall and may cause lower birthrates. It does not necessarily happen that way, but I won't go more into detail, because it doesn't matter, because the very first premise is not true at the US level (i.e. men are dropping out of the labor market). So it may happen, but at the US level it doesn't seem happening. If the author is talking about other areas, specific regions, groups, etc. this may be true, but then we have to have a specific context and talk about that, which is actually a good, necessary and useful thing to do."	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608ff29fae7378653b66648d	00016b18b2--608ff29fae7378653b66648d	APPROVED

"What is the argument here? That men are dropping out of society? What does ""dropping out of society"" mean? Who exactly are the men who are ""dropping out of society""? It seems that according to the author dropping out of society means not paying taxes/paying fewer taxes because they say that >if men start ""dropping out"" of society in large numbers, tax revenues will decline. We don't know what men the author talks about, and because of that, we can't decide if this claim is true or not. In the US, the employment rate is increasing since 2012, both for men and for women and slightly more for men (Source: OECD). So this data contradicts the claim that men are dropping out of society in the sense that they are dropping out of the labor market. It is surely true for some segment of men, and it would be useful to talk about them, but this argument is so generalizing that it doesn't support constructive discussion on the matter. And at this generalized level, this claim is not even true (it is not true in the EU either, I don't know about other countries). The author gives two reasons for men dropping out of the labor market. One is the loss in economic opportunities leading to the middle class, the other is the changes in the institution of marriage.

The law ratio (laws lobbied for by feminists for women and for men) and growing bias towards men shows the original motives of the 1st wave. Since people didn’t have stats and surveys to see the downsides of being men, they meant by equality to move up and be equal that way because they saw the obvious fact they were put below men. therefore, they mean “get better laws to be on par with men” rather then “make men and women equal in all ways” which explains why they act the way they act and why it doesn’t seem to live up with the latter defention. They didn’t know how bad it was.

"Its hard to say without being there, but in my experience these kinds of forces feed on your fear. Did you cleanse the house before moving in? If not I would literally sweep the house and use salt water to sever connections. If it's old and strong you may need help from your sisters to detach it. If you have any intuitive people (or animals!) in your life I would go room to room trying to find its ""nest"", or just the densest gathering of its energy so you can focus your intentions. Filling myself with light and compassion has been my go to in these scenarios which is hard when it ""attacks"" and you feel intrusive negativity. Friends help. Light helps. Love helps. But its like black mold, and even if you cleanse the hell out of it theres a chance the spores can find ways to linger and continue to grow. It can be an ongoing battle on that property.   Choose your battles wisely and protect yourself in the meantime."	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608ff3618b0a8f250df7f2d4	00016b18b2--608ff3618b0a8f250df7f2d4	APPROVED

I've seen some arguments that the voynich manuscript doesn't seem like an actual language and it does seem convincing. There are of course languages which we can't decipher like linear-a apparently. But the voynich manuscript seems to consist of mainly very few letters. There's one letter that appears in almost every word and sometimes three times in a row. Overall apparently the text mostly consists of just few letters, and there are many that are barely used. Of course it's possible it is a very different kind of language from any european languages which could help explain the odd abundance of certain characters, but apparently many think the text is actually gibberish	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608ff3618b0a8f250df7f2d4	00016b18b2--608ff3618b0a8f250df7f2d4	APPROVED

"[Betrayal: A Critical Analysis of Rape Culture in Anarchist Subcultures.](https://www.sproutdistro.com/catalog/zines/accountability-consent/betrayal) ""Despite claims that restorative justice is victim-centred, victims and their advocates were not actively engaged in early practice development (Mika et al. 2004). Early practitioners were largely defendant-oriented (Herman 2005), church-based (Fromme 2007; Pavlich 2005) and driven by “… religious or progressive concerns for the fate of criminal defendants … ” (Herman 2005, p. 578) amid increasing crime rates and an increasingly punitive environment of harsher sentencing. Herman (2005, p. 579) argued that the absence of a strong victim voice has “… reproduced many of the same deficiencies as the traditional justice system in respect to victims’ rights”. In the early days, victims were not central to restorative justice. The profound nature of this absence was highlighted by Zehr’s comments at a New Zealand hui (Māori term for meeting) in 2002: “[I] t took me a long time to realize how deeply embedded the offender orientation is in so many of us, and in our concept of justice… ” (Jülich 2003, p. 45). The same critique could be made of the theory that emerged to support the practice of restorative justice. As Ashworth (2002) noted, theory development has tended to be led by practice. Victims’ voices were similarly absent...restorative justice has not addressed structural inequality, discrimination or oppression, neither has it resolved pre-existing power imbalances between victim and offender, in particular for those offenders and victims who have a prior relationship or are known to each other (Stubbs 2002), as they most often are in sexual violence. Also, it would seem that some restorative processes might have further re-victimized victims by misusing power and coercion or they have used victim-offender encounters for the benefit of offenders (Braithwaite 2002; Strang 2002). There is some concern, for example, that a reduction in the severity of penalties following participation in a restorative process may encourage offenders to assume responsibility solely to access lighter sentences..."""	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608ff42d6efd841d6578b72e	00016b18b2--608ff42d6efd841d6578b72e	APPROVED

It depends. You can get a lawyer and your lawyer can try to get compensation for you. There is a time limit, though, like 300 days since the event happened. There are a lot of variables, though, like if you have evidence.Edit: It also depends on the case too. If it's like rape, you can get a lawyer and go to the police. Above I was thinking on other stuff, like language or commentary, that type of harassment.I recommend finding a lawyer (female) because I did and they don't charge you for talking to them and giving them information. They can analyze your case and give you options. If you want compensation and you have a good case, they'll get a % of whatever they can get for you. I did this, but my case was more in the discrimination/harassment area than *sexual harrassment area.*	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608ff446ae7378653b6679df	00016b18b2--608ff446ae7378653b6679df	APPROVED

I don't wear a bra in those cases. Strapless bras are just super uncomfortable for me and I think they fit worse than if I didn't wear a bra at all. I'm a 32E for reference. I don't take any special measures to make sure my breasts aren't shaking everywhere, they're just breasts and if I've taken the decision to wear a strappy dress then I'm accepting there's going to be some movement there - shock horror! I'm obviously not going to wear a strappy dress in any situation where there might be exercise or physical exertion, where it would get uncomfortable to be braless.	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608ff4472b838e47813cc604	00016b18b2--608ff4472b838e47813cc604	APPROVED

Main Street by Sinclair Lewis. I almost gave up on it but then assured myself a classic wouldn't be a classic if the ending were bad. Spoiler: the ending was as unsatisfying as the rest..2nd place is a romantic trash novel that started the book off with the love Interest accidentally raping the female protagonist after pegging her as a prostitute playing hard to get and not the virgin socialite she really was.

Feminist and MRA subreddits tend to get this way. Or political subreddits for that matter. The goals tend to take a back seat to proving that your side is right and their side is wrong. It gets to the point that people will downplay bad actions if their side is doing them even when they would normally be against that type of behaviour. Watching people on this subreddit attack AOC for saying she was sexually assaulted really highlights the hypocrisy. I don't think anyone here would attack a male saying he was assaulted and accuse them of lying. But a woman says she was a victim and its open season. I wish there was a more constructive place for helping men that had less anger. As some of the posts here are amazing.

"[Betrayal: A Critical Analysis of Rape Culture in Anarchist Subcultures.](https://www.sproutdistro.com/catalog/zines/accountability-consent/betrayal) ""Despite claims that restorative justice is victim-centred, victims and their advocates were not actively engaged in early practice development (Mika et al. 2004). Early practitioners were largely defendant-oriented (Herman 2005), church-based (Fromme 2007; Pavlich 2005) and driven by “… religious or progressive concerns for the fate of criminal defendants … ” (Herman 2005, p. 578) amid increasing crime rates and an increasingly punitive environment of harsher sentencing. Herman (2005, p. 579) argued that the absence of a strong victim voice has “… reproduced many of the same deficiencies as the traditional justice system in respect to victims’ rights”. In the early days, victims were not central to restorative justice. The profound nature of this absence was highlighted by Zehr’s comments at a New Zealand hui (Māori term for meeting) in 2002: “[I] t took me a long time to realize how deeply embedded the offender orientation is in so many of us, and in our concept of justice… ” (Jülich 2003, p. 45). The same critique could be made of the theory that emerged to support the practice of restorative justice. As Ashworth (2002) noted, theory development has tended to be led by practice. Victims’ voices were similarly absent...restorative justice has not addressed structural inequality, discrimination or oppression, neither has it resolved pre-existing power imbalances between victim and offender, in particular for those offenders and victims who have a prior relationship or are known to each other (Stubbs 2002), as they most often are in sexual violence. Also, it would seem that some restorative processes might have further re-victimized victims by misusing power and coercion or they have used victim-offender encounters for the benefit of offenders (Braithwaite 2002; Strang 2002). There is some concern, for example, that a reduction in the severity of penalties following participation in a restorative process may encourage offenders to assume responsibility solely to access lighter sentences..."""	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608ff49e45926237b6f842aa	00016b18b2--608ff49e45926237b6f842aa	APPROVED

Yes. We were close friends, had similar interests were nearly perfect for each other. But there was no chemistry whatsoever. We had been friends for years, he had always wanted more and at some point I felt something. And acted on it. And realised it wasn't enough. And dumped him. And felt horrible for years until we found each other on FB and I saw his pics with his beautiful wife, with whom he shares his passion and with whom he's definitely happy. I do not share his passion so I'm extra happy for him. And also, he used to be really insecure about his looks, he's the funny-cute type,but not conventionally handsome. And when we were just friends I kept telling him that he was going to have a hot wife. And guess what. His wife is really beautiful, there's warmth coming from her and he looks happy.

My ex used to snore LOUD. I'm a light sleeper so I didn't get much sleep whenever we shared a bed. After 2 months of dating I told him that if he wants a serious long term relationship, he has to fix the snoring ASAP or else I'd rather just end it. Good sleep is SO IMPORTANT, noone should have to deal with consistent lack of sleep. He got a sleep study and got diagnosed with sleep apnea and was given a CPAP machine.

It depends. You can get a lawyer and your lawyer can try to get compensation for you. There is a time limit, though, like 300 days since the event happened. There are a lot of variables, though, like if you have evidence.Edit: It also depends on the case too. If it's like rape, you can get a lawyer and go to the police. Above I was thinking on other stuff, like language or commentary, that type of harassment.I recommend finding a lawyer (female) because I did and they don't charge you for talking to them and giving them information. They can analyze your case and give you options. If you want compensation and you have a good case, they'll get a % of whatever they can get for you. I did this, but my case was more in the discrimination/harassment area than *sexual harrassment area.*	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608ff4f46fb3ed62c9283f49	00016b18b2--608ff4f46fb3ed62c9283f49	APPROVED

"[Betrayal: A Critical Analysis of Rape Culture in Anarchist Subcultures.](https://www.sproutdistro.com/catalog/zines/accountability-consent/betrayal) ""Despite claims that restorative justice is victim-centred, victims and their advocates were not actively engaged in early practice development (Mika et al. 2004). Early practitioners were largely defendant-oriented (Herman 2005), church-based (Fromme 2007; Pavlich 2005) and driven by “… religious or progressive concerns for the fate of criminal defendants … ” (Herman 2005, p. 578) amid increasing crime rates and an increasingly punitive environment of harsher sentencing. Herman (2005, p. 579) argued that the absence of a strong victim voice has “… reproduced many of the same deficiencies as the traditional justice system in respect to victims’ rights”. In the early days, victims were not central to restorative justice. The profound nature of this absence was highlighted by Zehr’s comments at a New Zealand hui (Māori term for meeting) in 2002: “[I] t took me a long time to realize how deeply embedded the offender orientation is in so many of us, and in our concept of justice… ” (Jülich 2003, p. 45). The same critique could be made of the theory that emerged to support the practice of restorative justice. As Ashworth (2002) noted, theory development has tended to be led by practice. Victims’ voices were similarly absent...restorative justice has not addressed structural inequality, discrimination or oppression, neither has it resolved pre-existing power imbalances between victim and offender, in particular for those offenders and victims who have a prior relationship or are known to each other (Stubbs 2002), as they most often are in sexual violence. Also, it would seem that some restorative processes might have further re-victimized victims by misusing power and coercion or they have used victim-offender encounters for the benefit of offenders (Braithwaite 2002; Strang 2002). There is some concern, for example, that a reduction in the severity of penalties following participation in a restorative process may encourage offenders to assume responsibility solely to access lighter sentences..."""	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608ff59182989918dae4036b	00016b18b2--608ff59182989918dae4036b	APPROVED

Feminist and MRA subreddits tend to get this way. Or political subreddits for that matter. The goals tend to take a back seat to proving that your side is right and their side is wrong. It gets to the point that people will downplay bad actions if their side is doing them even when they would normally be against that type of behaviour. Watching people on this subreddit attack AOC for saying she was sexually assaulted really highlights the hypocrisy. I don't think anyone here would attack a male saying he was assaulted and accuse them of lying. But a woman says she was a victim and its open season. I wish there was a more constructive place for helping men that had less anger. As some of the posts here are amazing.

It depends. You can get a lawyer and your lawyer can try to get compensation for you. There is a time limit, though, like 300 days since the event happened. There are a lot of variables, though, like if you have evidence.Edit: It also depends on the case too. If it's like rape, you can get a lawyer and go to the police. Above I was thinking on other stuff, like language or commentary, that type of harassment.I recommend finding a lawyer (female) because I did and they don't charge you for talking to them and giving them information. They can analyze your case and give you options. If you want compensation and you have a good case, they'll get a % of whatever they can get for you. I did this, but my case was more in the discrimination/harassment area than *sexual harrassment area.*	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608ff6536efd841d6578d38f	00016b18b2--608ff6536efd841d6578d38f	APPROVED

"What is the argument here? That men are dropping out of society? What does ""dropping out of society"" mean? Who exactly are the men who are ""dropping out of society""? It seems that according to the author dropping out of society means not paying taxes/paying fewer taxes because they say that >if men start ""dropping out"" of society in large numbers, tax revenues will decline. We don't know what men the author talks about, and because of that, we can't decide if this claim is true or not. In the US, the employment rate is increasing since 2012, both for men and for women and slightly more for men (Source: OECD). So this data contradicts the claim that men are dropping out of society in the sense that they are dropping out of the labor market. It is surely true for some segment of men, and it would be useful to talk about them, but this argument is so generalizing that it doesn't support constructive discussion on the matter. And at this generalized level, this claim is not even true (it is not true in the EU either, I don't know about other countries). The author gives two reasons for men dropping out of the labor market. One is the loss in economic opportunities leading to the middle class, the other is the changes in the institution of marriage. For the first, they say, that>many of the roads that led to the middle class have been closed. Entire industries have been crated up and shipped overseas. They say that because entire industries relocated overseas, many of the economic opportunities to maintain a middle-class life disappeared, which caused a decline in male employment. It may be a case in certain areas, but not at others. To decide if it is true or not, we should have an exact context. Again, this claim is just too generalized to spur a fruitful discussion. The second reason is that > marriage has been gutted to the point that a spouse can be better described as ""a roommate you have to pay a fortune to have evicted."" What? You don't have to marry if you don't want and what is the relationship between marriage and losing jobs? The argument seems to imply that men losing jobs because they have to pay in case of divorce. I can't comprehend this argument. Divorce laws may be bad, even biased against men, but how does it affect the employment status? Then the argument goes on to suggest areas to consider regarding this decline. The first is that > The overwhelming majority of government revenue is *collected from* men. This is just not true. In the US, 66.3% of men and 54.5% of women were working in 2018 - they all paid taxes. More men work, but it's not an overwhelming majority. In the EU, 54% of all working people were men and 46% were women. This doesn't seem like an ""overwhelming majority"". (Source: Eurostat)The second area to consider is that> The overwhelming majority of government benefits are *collected by* women. The overwhelming majority are collected by families and children. It is sad that mostly mothers have custody of children, so they get to get the money given to the children. It depends on the country and state of course, but please let me know benefits only available to women and is not related to children (I don't live in the US, so there might be). And the third is that> The overwhelming majority of consumer spending is *controlled by* women. What do you mean by ""controlled""? How do you measure it? It is a claim that is impossible to prove or disprove because of its vagueness. After stating that men are dropping out of society (which is not true at US level) and presenting three ""facts"" from which one is definitely not true, one is most likely not true but I could not find statistics on it, and one cannot be answered because of how it is phrased. And from these flawed facts, the argument concludes that social problems will arise. > if men start ""dropping out"" of society in large numbers, tax revenues will decline, entitlements will be cut, and consumer spending will fall. Also, birth rates will fall further, and given that our retirement programs rely on a large number of the young supporting the old, you have a recipe for trouble. The logic here might actually be true. So in a case when men start dropping out of the labor market, tax revenues will most likely decline. Because of that, entitlements may be cut in the long run. If there will be more unemployed men and also fewer entitlements, consumer spending would also fall and may cause lower birthrates. It does not necessarily happen that way, but I won't go more into detail, because it doesn't matter, because the very first premise is not true at the US level (i.e. men are dropping out of the labor market). So it may happen, but at the US level it doesn't seem happening. If the author is talking about other areas, specific regions, groups, etc. this may be true, but then we have to have a specific context and talk about that, which is actually a good, necessary and useful thing to do."	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608ff65b4b93044d50703f67	00016b18b2--608ff65b4b93044d50703f67	APPROVED

Feminist and MRA subreddits tend to get this way. Or political subreddits for that matter. The goals tend to take a back seat to proving that your side is right and their side is wrong. It gets to the point that people will downplay bad actions if their side is doing them even when they would normally be against that type of behaviour. Watching people on this subreddit attack AOC for saying she was sexually assaulted really highlights the hypocrisy. I don't think anyone here would attack a male saying he was assaulted and accuse them of lying. But a woman says she was a victim and its open season. I wish there was a more constructive place for helping men that had less anger. As some of the posts here are amazing. Theres just a lot of anger and pain that is directed towards women too.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608ff6b0b30a2654b329398a	00016b18b2--608ff6b0b30a2654b329398a	APPROVED

My ex used to snore LOUD. I'm a light sleeper so I didn't get much sleep whenever we shared a bed.

Good sleep is SO IMPORTANT, noone should have to deal with consistent lack of sleep. He got a sleep study and got diagnosed with sleep apnea and was given a CPAP machine.

"In Bavaria (province of Germany), it was recently decided that we are to wear FFP2 masks instead of community masks in public transport and supermarkets. The decision was made against the recommendation of the Robert Koch Institute, which is a government agency that researches disease control and prevention.The reasoning of our Minister-President, Markus Söder, is that the FFP2 masks will prevent an infection for the carrier of the mask as well as for their environment. That is true, if the mask is worn correctly.However, when I, a woman, wear a standard FFP2 mask, it is too big for my face. The mask is gaping at the chin and nose, even when using one of those masks with a metallic strip in it. Today, I noticed that I am not the only woman with this problem. The masks are gaping for all women I saw, while they do not gape for men. With my FFP2 mask, I am practically raw dogging train air. With the community mask I sewed myself, I never had this problem.My assumption is that the size of the masks are standardized to fit onto men's faces, as so many things are in our world. I am now stuck with buying special FFP2 masks made for my face, which will cost me more money. Friendly reminder here that women are, on average, much poorer than men due to a lot of women's work being unpaid and/or underpaid.I can practically see already how in two weeks, headlines will read ""Women in Bavaria are having way higher Covid numbers than men! Why are women being so careless and irresponsible?!"".In case you want to read more about it: https://themunicheye.com/ffp2-masks-now-compulsory-on-public-transport-3913EDIT: I am not against wearing a mask.

I've noticed this lately where people who are in a position of privilege being angry on behalf of people who belong to an oppressed group. On the surface, it may seem reasonable as they are, for all appearances, supporting that group.However, something leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth. A white person doesn't know a black person's experience. They don't know the anger and frustration that comes from a lifetime of discrimination and bigotry. Nor does a man know the experience of a woman. Or a straight person that of a gay person's experience.There lacks a sincerity of experience, the justification for the outrage seems hollow. I can't quite put my finger on it. It just seems wrong. Am I out to lunch?

"Interested to hear what feminists think on this topic.  What is causing men o drop out of society?&#x200B;I just went on a subreddit called purple pill to see what other say, this is what one user said is the reason: ""Men are ""dropping out"" of society for two reasons. First, many of the roads that led to the middle class have been closed. Entire industries have been crated up and shipped overseas. Second, marriage has been gutted to the point that a spouse can be better described as ""a roommate you have to pay a fortune to have evicted.""As far as the decline goes, reflect on the following:* The overwhelming majority of government revenue is *collected from* men.* The overwhelming majority of government benefits are *collected by* women.* The overwhelming majority of consumer spending is *controlled by* women.In short, if men start ""dropping out"" of society in large numbers, tax revenues will decline, entitlements will be cut, and consumer spending will fall. Also, birth rates will fall further, and given that our retirement programs rely on a large number of the young supporting the old, you have a recipe for trouble.""&#x200B;Obviously this is one side of the debate, so im interested to hear the other side."	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608ff86b022d7b13cb9a5f1d	00016b18b2--608ff86b022d7b13cb9a5f1d	APPROVED

"This isn’t toxic masculinity. These guys are typical 16 year old boys. The asphalt joke was stoopid. You didn’t think it was funny. It wasn’t sexist. They thought the word was funny. Ass phalt. For whatever reason lots of stereotypical boys think bad words are funny. Social situations require us to be social sometimes when we don’t feel like it. You made the decision not to laugh at them. You seem to feel superior to them. Maybe you are. Maybe you aren’t. Sometimes it’s fun to be silly. I think you could try to be a little silly. It won’t hurt anyone. You seem to not feel like you’re a part of their group. I’m guessing there are other groups you don’t feel apart of. It’s more fun to be included. They gave you an opportunity to include yourself. You opted out. Kids are dicks sometimes. Sometimes they’re not. When they made the masturbation comment you could have disarmed that too. It sounds like you’re wallowing in your otherness and victimhood. That’s a horrible mindset. Do what you can to get out of it?  Make a stooid joke. Have stoopid fun. Don’t be so serious. This was not an example of toxic masculinity. Be really really careful with that term. People who use it are trying to label any behaviour they don’t like as toxic. It’s a slippery slope. Their intent is the féminisation of boys and young men. Dick jokes are funny. Your dad and your mom jokes are funny. Don’t be so serious. Be a boy. Stop being a victim. Go tell those guys a joke. Here’s an old standby by I use.

Just remind your sexist friend that there are people out there who is ready to go rape or murder but they just cant do in public because of laws and afraid of being caught more than doing it and this is not okay or normal either. We are not in a jungle with wild animals anymore so why we should fear to go outside at night? Even I can be anxious when I am the last alone passenger at night even though Im very tall.

I have seen this perspective in a few different subreddits in a few different comment sections. I'm interested in diving into it further (pulling out my Ebscohost access and everything!), but I'm struggling to find much around which rights are typically referred to here. My vague recollection of what the premise of this argument would be is that brain dead people are not required to sustain the life of another individual whereas pregnant persons would be with restricted abortion access. Is this more about organ donation after brain death or conjoined twin situations? Or is it about some other corpse-rights situation? I've had a few false starts and just need to be pointed in the right direction on where to dive in.	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608ffb8082989918dae4553c	00016b18b2--608ffb8082989918dae4553c	APPROVED

I've noticed this lately where people who are in a position of privilege being angry on behalf of people who belong to an oppressed group. On the surface, it may seem reasonable as they are, for all appearances, supporting that group.However, something leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth. A white person doesn't know a black person's experience. They don't know the anger and frustration that comes from a lifetime of discrimination and bigotry. Nor does a man know the experience of a woman. Or a straight person that of a gay person's experience.There lacks a sincerity of experience, the justification for the outrage seems hollow. I can't quite put my finger on it. It just seems wrong. Am I out to lunch?

"Interested to hear what feminists think on this topic.  What is causing men o drop out of society?&#x200B;I just went on a subreddit called purple pill to see what other say, this is what one user said is the reason: ""Men are ""dropping out"" of society for two reasons. First, many of the roads that led to the middle class have been closed. Entire industries have been crated up and shipped overseas. Second, marriage has been gutted to the point that a spouse can be better described as ""a roommate you have to pay a fortune to have evicted.""As far as the decline goes, reflect on the following:* The overwhelming majority of government revenue is *collected from* men.* The overwhelming majority of government benefits are *collected by* women.* The overwhelming majority of consumer spending is *controlled by* women.In short, if men start ""dropping out"" of society in large numbers, tax revenues will decline, entitlements will be cut, and consumer spending will fall. Also, birth rates will fall further, and given that our retirement programs rely on a large number of the young supporting the old, you have a recipe for trouble.""&#x200B;Obviously this is one side of the debate, so im interested to hear the other side."	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608ffbf96efd841d65791c0a	00016b18b2--608ffbf96efd841d65791c0a	APPROVED

I’m tired too and I’m only 20. You just gotta remember why you’re a feminist, where would we be without feminists. When women first started to fight against misogyny all they saw was these men you described and worse. Most men (and even some women) thought they were crazy and ridiculous, FOR HAVING THE SAME IDEALS WE STILL HAVE TODAY. I’m tired but I consider myself lucky to be able to carry on what our sisters started for us. I know  that when they got tired they didn’t stop. For that reason alone I KNOW that even if we feel like we’re getting no where, in the future when we’re all gone and things have changed because WE didn’t stop when we got tired, our mothers, daughters, sister and especially our trans women will be safe and free. That alone is how and why we can’t stop. If you believe you as a woman shouldn’t feel scared, ripped off, judged, forced to do something or humiliated ect. just because you’re a woman, then you’re a feminist. That’s all it is and anyone who can’t understand that isn’t worth your breath.	1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608ffc50c00a69225eda63eb	00016b18b2--608ffc50c00a69225eda63eb	APPROVED

I've noticed this lately where people who are in a position of privilege being angry on behalf of people who belong to an oppressed group. On the surface, it may seem reasonable as they are, for all appearances, supporting that group.However, something leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth. A white person doesn't know a black person's experience. They don't know the anger and frustration that comes from a lifetime of discrimination and bigotry. Nor does a man know the experience of a woman. Or a straight person that of a gay person's experience.There lacks a sincerity of experience, the justification for the outrage seems hollow. I can't quite put my finger on it. It just seems wrong. Am I out to lunch?

"Interested to hear what feminists think on this topic.  What is causing men o drop out of society?&#x200B;I just went on a subreddit called purple pill to see what other say, this is what one user said is the reason: ""Men are ""dropping out"" of society for two reasons. First, many of the roads that led to the middle class have been closed. Entire industries have been crated up and shipped overseas. Second, marriage has been gutted to the point that a spouse can be better described as ""a roommate you have to pay a fortune to have evicted.""As far as the decline goes, reflect on the following:* The overwhelming majority of government revenue is *collected from* men.* The overwhelming majority of government benefits are *collected by* women.* The overwhelming majority of consumer spending is *controlled by* women.In short, if men start ""dropping out"" of society in large numbers, tax revenues will decline, entitlements will be cut, and consumer spending will fall. Also, birth rates will fall further, and given that our retirement programs rely on a large number of the young supporting the old, you have a recipe for trouble.""&#x200B;Obviously this is one side of the debate, so im interested to hear the other side."	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608ffd95b30a2654b3299e0a	00016b18b2--608ffd95b30a2654b3299e0a	APPROVED

Sexual abuse and childhood neglect. I’m glad he felt comfortable and vulnerable enough to share it with me. His parents were young and not focused on caring for my SO and his younger brother. He would have to steal food from the grocery store. I used to think that made me the saddest until he finally asked his mom if his dad ever held a gun to her head. He had. My SO was four years old at the time. He’s carried it silently with him until just about a month ago. So much trauma for a little boy. We’re having our first baby in a few moths- a little boy. I know he’s going to give our son all the love he had missed out on as a child. It’s part of his love towards me. He sees how nurturing and caring I am with him and others around me.

In 1965, she tried again, waiting in line for hours. The sheriff ordered her to leave, prodding her in the neck with a billy club, until she turned around and punched him in the jaw, knocking him to the ground. After being jailed, she became a registered voter. Following the Voting Rights Act, the sheriff was voted out. Annie Lee Cooper lived to be 100. The sheriff was eventually jailed for conspiring to smuggle drugs. ---^^I'm&#32;a&#32;human&#32;volunteer&#32;content&#32;transcriber&#32;for&#32;Reddit&#32;and&#32;you&#32;could&#32;be&#32;too!&#32;[If&#32;you'd&#32;like&#32;more&#32;information&#32;on&#32;what&#32;we&#32;do&#32;and&#32;why&#32;we&#32;do&#32;it,&#32;click&#32;here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit/wiki/index)	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--608fff4338e2f73c3f1c70a7	00016b18b2--608fff4338e2f73c3f1c70a7	APPROVED

If a woman chose of her own free will to go around telling all other women that they should be submissive because that is women's natural role in life, is that a feminist choice?

"There is a radical Feminist artist collective called 'claire fontaine' after a popular French brand of notebooks who make artwork dealing with Feminist and capitalist topics.   Here is their website: https://www.clairefontaine.ws/   And here is their letter to the visitor: https://www.clairefontaine.ws/index  There is also the O.G. French Feminist Simone de Beauvoir whose major work ""The Second Sex"" set the stage for contemporary discussions of gender theory.    Another prominent French Feminist is Luce Irigaray who works on language within the framework of analysis of phallocentrism as well as analysis through a Marxist framework of Feminist topics and critiques of a range of philosophers and their thought through a critical Feminist lens.   Julia Kristeva and Hélène Cixous are also prominent French Feminist thinkers whose work falls within postructuralism (and also structuralism in Krisreva's case). Kristeva deals with literary theory and critique as well as semiotics (within linguistics the study of signs, signifiers, and the signified) among others. Cixous is associated with Derrida (they published a book together) and her work deals with language and communication and how they interrelate with sexuality among other topics.

"What if, for example, the pay gap is not erased through achieving egalitarian legislation and social reforms (gender neutral children's toys, etc.)?

I was talking to a girl whose cleavage was a bit exposed (and I am NOT criticizing her or her right to dress like this) and as we were speaking, my eyes sort of drifted down to the area between her neck and her breasts, for maybe a bit longer then they should have.As we were taking, she covered her shirt up a little, then my eyes immediately moved back up to her eyes and stayed there. She didn’t explicitly say anything (of course, this could’ve been because it wouldn’t have been worth her trouble), we continued to talk afterwards, and she didn’t appear hostile, but I couldn’t help but feel that I might’ve made her uncomfortable. I genuinely feel terrible and contrite about what I did.I initially considered what I did to be a disrespectful and embarrassing faux pas, and something from which I should learn to refrain from such behavior in the future. Yet for whatever reason I began to dwell uncontrollably on what I did, and with each instance of contemplation my perception of my action worsened.I should preface by explaining that in the past I've had tics that compel me to do things I otherwise shouldn't do. One such example consists of looking at my feet a total of four glances while I'm driving, precisely because I know I'm not supposed to. Similarly, when swimming underwater, I feel compelled often to open my mouth and let water in four times, as I know that it would be best not to do so. These tics may seem trivial, but they have been natural for me for a long time.Such tics have been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. I say this not to convey that these tics have made my life unbearable—they have not; rather, my purpose is to explain that these tics have become normalized for me. I’ve always suspected there may be an attention deficit component to these tics.When I was young, I developed a similar tic-like habit whereby I would look at private parts. This eventually developed into something where I knew I wasn’t supposed to do something, but precisely because of this I felt compelled to do it anyway. I don't know why this tic in general developed. Was it due to the frequent thoughts about sex I had when I was 6/7? Was it due to innocuous portrayals of such behavior in movies/TV? I’d feel the need to steal glances at a private area a total of four times, in general. This urge has been there not just with women’s décolletage, but also with mens’ crotches at times, or women’s legs. This is especially true when I’m engaged in conversation with someone. This urge-driven tic wouldn’t necessarily always be there in every single interaction, but through some interactions it would be there.It’s not that I deliberately try to leer or to make people uncomfortable. I don't openly stare, for instance, at a woman's chest for 10 seconds with wide eyes while drooling. I've never made comments, or touched, or tried to take up someone's personal space. I’m not trying to prey on people, or to try to impose myself on them sexually. For whatever reason, it's like when talking to a woman for extended time, it's hard for me to keep still in general. My eyes wander haphazardly, and combined with this tic, this happens.And yet my reasons should not matter as much as the effects of what I did to her. She covered her shirt, and odds are good I made her feel uncomfortable. In the moment, I ascribed what happened here to my tic, and judged that I had been rude and disrespectful at worst, and that if I learned from this, I could move on. But over time, my dwelling in this became far worse. She'd continued talking to me during that conversation, and she wasn't hostile, true. But what was she not showing me? How can I be sure exactly how bad I made her feel? Maybe I ruined her day. Maybe I ruined her whole week. Maybe I made her feel less of herself. Maybe I've affected her life immutably. Are these exaggerations? Am I obsessing over this to an unreasonable degree, or are these possible, reasonable ramifications of what I did?Furthermore, I began to fear that maybe, whilst I'd believed that I was never openly leering/ogling at people, what if I'd been wrong ever since I'd developed this tic? How many countless women could I have potentially made uncomfortable? No one has ever prior indicated that my presence made them uncomfortable. I've never been reported for anything even remotely minor. And yet I feel I can't be sure. I remember now just one other instance, from when I was younger, when a girl at school covered her shirt while I was talking to her. This is the only other time covering shirt had occurred. Was this due to my tic too?As I read stories of people like Morgan Freeman, Bill O'Rielly and their workplace sexual transgressions, I see small, maybe if only tangential, similarities between what they did and what I did. Men like this have commented in women's figures in the workplace, touched their skirts, asked them how they 'feel about sexual harassment.' These transgressions seem to me patently wrong and inexcusable. And yet another thing they've been accused of is leering women up and down. Coupled with their other systematic patterns of behavior, it seems as though this leering should be construed as further attempts to make women uncomfortable in the workplace. And although I've never been party to these other types of behavior, I can't help but feel peripherally associate with these men.Ultimately, I cannot ascertain for certain to what extent my actions in this instance stemmed from normalized tics, and to what extent it arose from subconscious irreverence for her person. I have little doubt that what I did stamp largely from a dependence on my normalized tics. Yet if I submitted to this tic, is this not the same as being irreverent to her person? Maybe I am no better than a Morgan Freeman/Bill O'Rielly.I've been hoping that the fact that she may not have even noticed, or likely forgot about what happened soon thereafter, may mean that I should get to move on if I promise to do better. But why not take this logic to completion? If a man rapes a woman, and she was too drunk or incapacitated to remember it, does this make him any less of a rapist? By the same logic, would her forgetting this make me any less of a harasser? Of a predator? I understand that to conflate rape with looking at cleavage would be disingenuous at best and malicious at worst—that's not my purpose. My purpose is to test this line of logic.I cannot live with myself thinking of myself as a sexual harasser. This label has been weighing on me for months at this point. I can't eat properly, and can't get assignments done, I'm hardly sleeping. Sound funny, or facetious? I'm being genuine. I am deeply sorry for what I did, and I understand now not only that what I did was wrong, but also why it was wrong. I am cognizant now of how differently women can perceive objectification, and that, even if my tics become difficult to resist, this is no excuse at all for disrespecting someone else's person. But I can't go on thinking of myself as a sexual harasser. I just can't.There are only two ways in which I could deviate from this course of action, either by rationalizing my actions or by and living with myself that way, or by accepting what I did, which would—even if only slightly peripherally—place me in a category of individuals with whom I am unequivocally unwilling to be associated. To commit to the former path would be to lead my life with unconscionable dishonesty; the latter, to undergo such a radical change in self-perception for which I have not the strength.There is no impartial mediator to help me guide my thoughts. I had one feminist friend who told me that I'm overreacting. Yet I'm confident that there would be other people who would say I'm not overreacting. But if one person thinks I'm a sexual harasser, there must be legitimacy to that, yes? If I'm even .5% associated with a group of people including Freeman, O'Rielly, Ansari, etc. I can't live right myself.I have virtually no concern with being potentially reported for sexual harassment. This isn't about that. It's about how I see myself. Judge me as you wish.	1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--6090008938e2f73c3f1c8454	00016b18b2--6090008938e2f73c3f1c8454	APPROVED

I think it’s probably highly variable based on the individual but one thing that makes it great for me is when I know my partner really wants to and is enjoying it. They’re not just doing it out if obligation.I think one other tip is if I’m giving signs I’m enjoying what you’re doing keep doing it if you want me to finish. Don’t change technique every five seconds because it almost interrupts the build up and can be maybe not a total reset but somewhat of a reset. Other things are probably more personal or specific to me I think. Which the number one tip is ask your partner what they like! Pay attention to noises and body language and adjust accordingly.	1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609001d57a19413e31855cde	00016b18b2--609001d57a19413e31855cde	APPROVED
My partner and I have been together since I was 17 and he was 19. Married at 23 and 25. We are 35 and 37 now. A lot of these have been mentioned by others but...Pros: We are best friends. I’ve known my husband longer than any non-family person in my life. We seen each other grow and mature as people, then as parents. This doesn’t work for everyone, but the people we’ve turned into are very compatible— luckily. We’ve shared nearly every good and bad moment of our lives. We know each other deeply and honestly. We were able to have kids young and will have time to be older adults, together. Cons: My husband has never lived alone. I did have my years away in college to be on my own, but he continued to live with his mom through that. We are a little too codependent, given we had a very little amount of time to figure out what true independence looks like. We rely on each other I situations where we maybe don’t have to and I think that can effect our self esteem. But, we are actively working on that and it’s getting better. I think it’s hard to delineate our persons when we’ve been together so long. Sometimes it feels like we’re just one person split into two— but maybe that’s actually a pro?!	1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609001d57a19413e31855cde	00016b18b2--609001d57a19413e31855cde	APPROVED

"Individual accounts, though often anecdotal, help comprise a working pattern of how men are treated. Any true story is worth hearing and understanding in order to protect one's person. I believe dumping is equally valid, because where else do men truly get to vent? I have yet to find a real world place to talk openly about  issues men face? Why? Many people either don't believe, don't care, or also hate men.Feminism has huge leverage, and one can readily find phrases such as ""kill all men"" or other legitimate hate speech aimed at destroying men. If ever this place became a dumping ground against women, their actions, and the legal/social bias against men, I would still support it. We can collectively share, learn, expose those who actively try to harm, and hopefully grow stronger. To have that sort of bond requires real stories from people's lives, as I know of nobody who develops a bond over statistics.Should it be complaining without a goal? No. Complain, find help, draw strength, continue on and keep trying to fix what can be fixed. Sometimes, things also aren't fixable due to how rigged society is (mental health being severely gate-kept from men in my experience), and we can still seek social help, educate, etc.Social forums or situations aren't static;they ebb and flow. This sub will, too. But, let men complain, let them vent, and let them ease their anger in a better setting than they otherwise have."	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609002f15205fe7265874bc0	00016b18b2--609002f15205fe7265874bc0	APPROVED

Husband cheated. Two kids. I did the pick me dance (Gross, I know).  Didn’t want my kids coming from a divorced home like I did.  Stayed with him, refused to check up on him, gave him 100% of my trust.  Accidentally caught him trying to reach out to her again, of course he denied.  Still I struggled, I knew once I made the decision to go there was no turning back. (if I didn’t have kids I could’ve made that decision in a heartbeat and the first time). Prayed to God to show me a sign to tell me if I should stay or go.  Kept seeing things and didn’t know if they were the signs. Screamed at God to show me a sign that I could not ignore. The next day or so, my daughter called me at work to tell me he had hit my son who was 11.  I came home so his handprint on my sons ass and that was when I decided, “I can’t do this anymore“.I called the lawyer, started the divorce proceedings and moved out with my kids.	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--6090037d8b0a8f250df8ecba	00016b18b2--6090037d8b0a8f250df8ecba	APPROVED

Time and therapy. When he broke things off, I was told it was due to flaws in my character.

24 - I married him. I'm not religious or have any cultural reasons why I would want to marry my first boyfriend, it just turned out that way. I hated being the 24 year old who had never dated and had had one drunken kiss (not even a snog, just a peck), but in retrospect I think I was very lucky. I knew who I was as an adult individual - I had made my life plans and career choices without having to compromise - not that you *need* to compromise on those things to have a relationship, but I think I was the sort of person who was indecisive and flexible when I was a teenager and in my very early 20s and I probably would have made more compromises than I should have if I had had a serious relationship then.	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609004820b14ef5c4fde0e2e	00016b18b2--609004820b14ef5c4fde0e2e	APPROVED

It tends to happen when I'm not doing spellwork, but when I sit down quietly (in the bath, that seems to be my sweet spot for communicating lately) and just talk with my goddesses. Usually the only time I take off my public mask and discuss my true fears and desires, what I would like help with, and offer gratitude and love. Always ends in sobbing, nothing to do with sadness, just a tsunami of emotion. I know it is is cleansing but it is also utterly emotionally exhausting. Just me? I've got plans to dance myself silly at 8:30, with my fellow Phish fans, tonight's tub talk kicked my butt.	1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609006194c606f068674379d	00016b18b2--609006194c606f068674379d	APPROVED

"Caring for a partner or family member with a mental health issue, because it's not something you can often talk about fully with that person. There's a thin line between sharing your honest feelings and inadvertently making a person with clinical depression or thoughts of self harm feel even more like a burden -- not exactly what you want to do.There's just very little practical information or support for the day to day issues of caregiving, especially where mental health is concerned. What do you say or do when someone you love is having a panic attack? Expressing suicidal thoughts at 3am on a Wednesday? How do you help ensure a fellow adult takes extremely necessary medication consistently if they struggle with routines and patterns? How do you balance all of this with a demanding job and being the primary manager of all household labour? What does it do to your own mental health, and how can you balance the functional responsibilities of caregiving with the responsibilities of your own health, mental or physical? Who knows? Maybe you can figure it all out with the three 30min ""well-being"" hotline sessions your employer allocates each year? The stigma around mental health is a huge issue, primarily for helping people manage their own and to seek help when they need it. But the secondary impact is that caregivers *also* feel ashamed and secretive, because 1) it may not feel like their own issue to 'share' with others, especially mutual friends and acquaintances, and 2) it's impossible not to feel like people will doubt you or simply conclude that you made poor relationship decisions somehow. While I don't want to minimise the caregiving challenges of someone looking after a loved one with cancer or another serious physical health issue, at least you can be sure that only the worst of humanity will treat it like a non-problem if you tell them what's happening."	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--6090066ddce1aa1bd0169eb3	00016b18b2--6090066ddce1aa1bd0169eb3	APPROVED

I think it’s probably highly variable based on the individual but one thing that makes it great for me is when I know my partner really wants to and is enjoying it. They’re not just doing it out if obligation.I think one other tip is if I’m giving signs I’m enjoying what you’re doing keep doing it if you want me to finish. Don’t change technique every five seconds because it almost interrupts the build up and can be maybe not a total reset but somewhat of a reset. Other things are probably more personal or specific to me I think. Which the number one tip is ask your partner what they like! Pay attention to noises and body language and adjust accordingly.	1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609006ab8b0a8f250df911d1	00016b18b2--609006ab8b0a8f250df911d1	APPROVED
My partner and I have been together since I was 17 and he was 19. Married at 23 and 25. We are 35 and 37 now. A lot of these have been mentioned by others but...Pros: We are best friends. I’ve known my husband longer than any non-family person in my life. We seen each other grow and mature as people, then as parents. This doesn’t work for everyone, but the people we’ve turned into are very compatible— luckily. We’ve shared nearly every good and bad moment of our lives. We know each other deeply and honestly. We were able to have kids young and will have time to be older adults, together. Cons: My husband has never lived alone. I did have my years away in college to be on my own, but he continued to live with his mom through that. We are a little too codependent, given we had a very little amount of time to figure out what true independence looks like. We rely on each other I situations where we maybe don’t have to and I think that can effect our self esteem. But, we are actively working on that and it’s getting better. I think it’s hard to delineate our persons when we’ve been together so long. Sometimes it feels like we’re just one person split into two— but maybe that’s actually a pro?!	1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609006ab8b0a8f250df911d1	00016b18b2--609006ab8b0a8f250df911d1	APPROVED

"What if, for example, the pay gap is not erased through achieving egalitarian legislation and social reforms (gender neutral children's toys, etc.)? What if the choices males and females choose, free from any gender influencing, etc. leads to more males still in higher risk jobs, working longer hours, and/or being in higher paid jobs than females?

BTW, this is in no means a question meant to say we shouldn't be attempting to reach true equity/equality between the genders, I am honestly curious to what defines ""success"" and to what lengths one believes society should go to achieve them (ie strip away free employment choice?

I was talking to a girl whose cleavage was a bit exposed (and I am NOT criticizing her or her right to dress like this) and as we were speaking, my eyes sort of drifted down to the area between her neck and her breasts, for maybe a bit longer then they should have.As we were taking, she covered her shirt up a little, then my eyes immediately moved back up to her eyes and stayed there. She didn’t explicitly say anything (of course, this could’ve been because it wouldn’t have been worth her trouble), we continued to talk afterwards, and she didn’t appear hostile, but I couldn’t help but feel that I might’ve made her uncomfortable. I genuinely feel terrible and contrite about what I did.I initially considered what I did to be a disrespectful and embarrassing faux pas, and something from which I should learn to refrain from such behavior in the future. Yet for whatever reason I began to dwell uncontrollably on what I did, and with each instance of contemplation my perception of my action worsened.I should preface by explaining that in the past I've had tics that compel me to do things I otherwise shouldn't do. One such example consists of looking at my feet a total of four glances while I'm driving, precisely because I know I'm not supposed to. Similarly, when swimming underwater, I feel compelled often to open my mouth and let water in four times, as I know that it would be best not to do so. These tics may seem trivial, but they have been natural for me for a long time.Such tics have been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. I say this not to convey that these tics have made my life unbearable—they have not; rather, my purpose is to explain that these tics have become normalized for me. I’ve always suspected there may be an attention deficit component to these tics.When I was young, I developed a similar tic-like habit whereby I would look at private parts. This eventually developed into something where I knew I wasn’t supposed to do something, but precisely because of this I felt compelled to do it anyway. I don't know why this tic in general developed. Was it due to the frequent thoughts about sex I had when I was 6/7? Was it due to innocuous portrayals of such behavior in movies/TV? I’d feel the need to steal glances at a private area a total of four times, in general. This urge has been there not just with women’s décolletage, but also with mens’ crotches at times, or women’s legs. This is especially true when I’m engaged in conversation with someone. This urge-driven tic wouldn’t necessarily always be there in every single interaction, but through some interactions it would be there.It’s not that I deliberately try to leer or to make people uncomfortable. I don't openly stare, for instance, at a woman's chest for 10 seconds with wide eyes while drooling. I've never made comments, or touched, or tried to take up someone's personal space. I’m not trying to prey on people, or to try to impose myself on them sexually. For whatever reason, it's like when talking to a woman for extended time, it's hard for me to keep still in general. My eyes wander haphazardly, and combined with this tic, this happens.And yet my reasons should not matter as much as the effects of what I did to her. She covered her shirt, and odds are good I made her feel uncomfortable. In the moment, I ascribed what happened here to my tic, and judged that I had been rude and disrespectful at worst, and that if I learned from this, I could move on. But over time, my dwelling in this became far worse. She'd continued talking to me during that conversation, and she wasn't hostile, true. But what was she not showing me? How can I be sure exactly how bad I made her feel? Maybe I ruined her day. Maybe I ruined her whole week. Maybe I made her feel less of herself. Maybe I've affected her life immutably. Are these exaggerations? Am I obsessing over this to an unreasonable degree, or are these possible, reasonable ramifications of what I did?Furthermore, I began to fear that maybe, whilst I'd believed that I was never openly leering/ogling at people, what if I'd been wrong ever since I'd developed this tic? How many countless women could I have potentially made uncomfortable? No one has ever prior indicated that my presence made them uncomfortable. I've never been reported for anything even remotely minor. And yet I feel I can't be sure. I remember now just one other instance, from when I was younger, when a girl at school covered her shirt while I was talking to her. This is the only other time covering shirt had occurred. Was this due to my tic too?As I read stories of people like Morgan Freeman, Bill O'Rielly and their workplace sexual transgressions, I see small, maybe if only tangential, similarities between what they did and what I did. Men like this have commented in women's figures in the workplace, touched their skirts, asked them how they 'feel about sexual harassment.' These transgressions seem to me patently wrong and inexcusable. And yet another thing they've been accused of is leering women up and down. Coupled with their other systematic patterns of behavior, it seems as though this leering should be construed as further attempts to make women uncomfortable in the workplace. And although I've never been party to these other types of behavior, I can't help but feel peripherally associate with these men.Ultimately, I cannot ascertain for certain to what extent my actions in this instance stemmed from normalized tics, and to what extent it arose from subconscious irreverence for her person. I have little doubt that what I did stamp largely from a dependence on my normalized tics. Yet if I submitted to this tic, is this not the same as being irreverent to her person? Maybe I am no better than a Morgan Freeman/Bill O'Rielly.I've been hoping that the fact that she may not have even noticed, or likely forgot about what happened soon thereafter, may mean that I should get to move on if I promise to do better. But why not take this logic to completion? If a man rapes a woman, and she was too drunk or incapacitated to remember it, does this make him any less of a rapist? By the same logic, would her forgetting this make me any less of a harasser? Of a predator? I understand that to conflate rape with looking at cleavage would be disingenuous at best and malicious at worst—that's not my purpose. My purpose is to test this line of logic.I cannot live with myself thinking of myself as a sexual harasser. This label has been weighing on me for months at this point. I can't eat properly, and can't get assignments done, I'm hardly sleeping. Sound funny, or facetious? I'm being genuine. I am deeply sorry for what I did, and I understand now not only that what I did was wrong, but also why it was wrong. I am cognizant now of how differently women can perceive objectification, and that, even if my tics become difficult to resist, this is no excuse at all for disrespecting someone else's person. But I can't go on thinking of myself as a sexual harasser. I just can't.There are only two ways in which I could deviate from this course of action, either by rationalizing my actions or by and living with myself that way, or by accepting what I did, which would—even if only slightly peripherally—place me in a category of individuals with whom I am unequivocally unwilling to be associated. To commit to the former path would be to lead my life with unconscionable dishonesty; the latter, to undergo such a radical change in self-perception for which I have not the strength.There is no impartial mediator to help me guide my thoughts. I had one feminist friend who told me that I'm overreacting. Yet I'm confident that there would be other people who would say I'm not overreacting. But if one person thinks I'm a sexual harasser, there must be legitimacy to that, yes? If I'm even .5% associated with a group of people including Freeman, O'Rielly, Ansari, etc. I can't live right myself.I have virtually no concern with being potentially reported for sexual harassment. This isn't about that. It's about how I see myself. Judge me as you wish.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--60900753591bb91d915e4df4	00016b18b2--60900753591bb91d915e4df4	APPROVED

Like, my memory is so bad it’s hard for me to be properly resentful most of the time because I just sorta forget about people who did me dirty in the past. I do have a friend who sometimes requires extra understanding and patience, and she has done hurtful things to me, but I am able to let those things go because 1) they were situational, and I feel in control enough to make sure I never put myself in that situation again with her and 2) I know there are times in my life where I was/am the asshole.

Isn't it because it's gendered? Pointlessly gendered as the sub would say.There's the trope you identify, about undermining a woman that speaks out, because a woman speaking out is of itself unacceptable.Then there's the identification of the unreasonableness of the complaint in a gendered name. But both men and women are unreasonable, make silly complaints, are thoughtless. But only when a woman does it is that person called a Karen. (Altho actually, i think i have once seen a man referred to as being a Karen. But in some ways that was even worse, since it demanded that certain traits be seen as necessarily female...)The mistake lies in that, almost always in my experience, the criticism against the Karen is valid. But that doesn't mean we have to be sexist in calling it out. I don't use the term. Disclosure time. I identify as a man. Please excuse/forgive if this therefore constitutes mansplaining.	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609007f9dd05ff4c5a354610	00016b18b2--609007f9dd05ff4c5a354610	APPROVED

People can do what they want, but I have a serious problem with this sort of thing when it's called feminism. Sexualizing yourself is your right, but it's certainly not feminist and you're still contributing to the objectification and sexualization of women as a whole. I understand that you could consider making a fortune off of straight male sexuality some sort of empowering, but you're also pandering to the patriarchy in the process. As you said, it's none of my business what people choose to do with their body, but as a feminist, I'm going to criticize this trend and what it means for women without attacking the individual woman. I especially think this is damaging to young girls and teenagers who are now being thought that empowerment comes from showing off as much of their body as possible and all that matters is how popular you are on social media. I don't have a TikTok, but I've read some horror stories of pedophilia on there with adult men convincing pre-pubescent girls to twerk for them and these girls thinking it's fine because they see the likes of Cardi B do the same thing on TV.	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609007f9dd05ff4c5a354610	00016b18b2--609007f9dd05ff4c5a354610	APPROVED

I think it’s probably highly variable based on the individual but one thing that makes it great for me is when I know my partner really wants to and is enjoying it. They’re not just doing it out if obligation.I think one other tip is if I’m giving signs I’m enjoying what you’re doing keep doing it if you want me to finish. Don’t change technique every five seconds because it almost interrupts the build up and can be maybe not a total reset but somewhat of a reset. Other things are probably more personal or specific to me I think. Which the number one tip is ask your partner what they like!

My partner and I have been together since I was 17 and he was 19. Married at 23 and 25. We are 35 and 37 now. A lot of these have been mentioned by others but...Pros: We are best friends. I’ve known my husband longer than any non-family person in my life. We seen each other grow and mature as people, then as parents. This doesn’t work for everyone, but the people we’ve turned into are very compatible— luckily. We’ve shared nearly every good and bad moment of our lives. We know each other deeply and honestly. We were able to have kids young and will have time to be older adults, together. Cons: My husband has never lived alone. I did have my years away in college to be on my own, but he continued to live with his mom through that. We are a little too codependent, given we had a very little amount of time to figure out what true independence looks like. We rely on each other I situations where we maybe don’t have to and I think that can effect our self esteem. But, we are actively working on that and it’s getting better. I think it’s hard to delineate our persons when we’ve been together so long. Sometimes it feels like we’re just one person split into two— but maybe that’s actually a pro?!	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--6090088a6b43067ad4a27413	00016b18b2--6090088a6b43067ad4a27413	APPROVED

My ex used to snore LOUD. I'm a light sleeper so I didn't get much sleep whenever we shared a bed. After 2 months of dating I told him that if he wants a serious long term relationship, he has to fix the snoring ASAP or else I'd rather just end it. Good sleep is SO IMPORTANT, noone should have to deal with consistent lack of sleep. He got a sleep study and got diagnosed with sleep apnea and was given a CPAP machine. It was a great solution as it allowed me to sleep through the night and also allowed him to have better and deeper sleep.	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609008c95205fe726587b875	00016b18b2--609008c95205fe726587b875	APPROVED

My friends mostly are introverted, and some are shy, though I have extroverted friends. Interestingly I am more likely to date extroverts. I think it’s because they’d do the asking out.

I’m tired too and I’m only 20. You just gotta remember why you’re a feminist, where would we be without feminists. When women first started to fight against misogyny all they saw was these men you described and worse. Most men (and even some women) thought they were crazy and ridiculous, FOR HAVING THE SAME IDEALS WE STILL HAVE TODAY. I’m tired but I consider myself lucky to be able to carry on what our sisters started for us. I know  that when they got tired they didn’t stop. For that reason alone I KNOW that even if we feel like we’re getting no where, in the future when we’re all gone and things have changed because WE didn’t stop when we got tired, our mothers, daughters, sister and especially our trans women will be safe and free. That alone is how and why we can’t stop. If you believe you as a woman shouldn’t feel scared, ripped off, judged, forced to do something or humiliated ect. just because you’re a woman, then you’re a feminist. That’s all it is and anyone who can’t understand that isn’t worth your breath.	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609009366efd841d6579f02b	00016b18b2--609009366efd841d6579f02b	APPROVED

"This is left over from old times when a wife not having had sex before marriage was the only way to ""ensure"" she wasn't already pregnant from someone else and you wouldn't invest scarce resources into someone else's genes. Because viginity tests are sooo reliable. Now that we have paternity tests and proper contraception, it's no loger necessary and there is really no need for purity and innocence in sexual contexts. I think it speaks volumes about a man if he wants a pure or innocent girl (let's be real: they don't want women, they want girls), and women shouldn't fall for that anymore."	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--6090099c13b306608c04b901	00016b18b2--6090099c13b306608c04b901	APPROVED
Once I argued with my mom about how woman should be prepared with enough self defense to everything evertime and she labeled me as a misogynist. And I feel so foolish and wrong about my past self. And I despise even the people who inherits same opinion as my past self but I despise even more the people are sexist and blaming victims. Just remind your sexist friend that there are people out there who is ready to go rape or murder but they just cant do in public because of laws and afraid of being caught more than doing it and this is not okay or normal either. We are not in a jungle with wild animals anymore so why we should fear to go outside at night? Even I can be anxious when I am the last alone passenger at night even though Im very tall. I avoid to follow woman or passing her without even getting near to not to make her afraid because she can think Im stalking. To just emphatise I think about what peoples worst act on every possible situation if I were woman, because its what society expects to do for woman but its just terryfying.	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--6090099c13b306608c04b901	00016b18b2--6090099c13b306608c04b901	APPROVED

I have seen this perspective in a few different subreddits in a few different comment sections. I'm interested in diving into it further (pulling out my Ebscohost access and everything!), but I'm struggling to find much around which rights are typically referred to here. My vague recollection of what the premise of this argument would be is that brain dead people are not required to sustain the life of another individual whereas pregnant persons would be with restricted abortion access. Is this more about organ donation after brain death or conjoined twin situations? Or is it about some other corpse-rights situation? I've had a few false starts and just need to be pointed in the right direction on where to dive in.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--6090099c13b306608c04b901	00016b18b2--6090099c13b306608c04b901	APPROVED

Husband cheated. Two kids. I did the pick me dance (Gross, I know).  Didn’t want my kids coming from a divorced home like I did.  Stayed with him, refused to check up on him, gave him 100% of my trust.  Accidentally caught him trying to reach out to her again, of course he denied.  Still I struggled, I knew once I made the decision to go there was no turning back. (if I didn’t have kids I could’ve made that decision in a heartbeat and the first time). Prayed to God to show me a sign to tell me if I should stay or go.  Kept seeing things and didn’t know if they were the signs. Screamed at God to show me a sign that I could not ignore. The next day or so, my daughter called me at work to tell me he had hit my son who was 11.  I came home so his handprint on my sons ass and that was when I decided, “I can’t do this anymore“.I called the lawyer, started the divorce proceedings and moved out with my kids.	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--60900a0e6b43067ad4a2a848	00016b18b2--60900a0e6b43067ad4a2a848	APPROVED

"Caring for a partner or family member with a mental health issue, because it's not something you can often talk about fully with that person. There's a thin line between sharing your honest feelings and inadvertently making a person with clinical depression or thoughts of self harm feel even more like a burden -- not exactly what you want to do.There's just very little practical information or support for the day to day issues of caregiving, especially where mental health is concerned. What do you say or do when someone you love is having a panic attack? Expressing suicidal thoughts at 3am on a Wednesday? How do you help ensure a fellow adult takes extremely necessary medication consistently if they struggle with routines and patterns? How do you balance all of this with a demanding job and being the primary manager of all household labour? What does it do to your own mental health, and how can you balance the functional responsibilities of caregiving with the responsibilities of your own health, mental or physical? Who knows? Maybe you can figure it all out with the three 30min ""well-being"" hotline sessions your employer allocates each year? The stigma around mental health is a huge issue, primarily for helping people manage their own and to seek help when they need it. But the secondary impact is that caregivers *also* feel ashamed and secretive, because 1) it may not feel like their own issue to 'share' with others, especially mutual friends and acquaintances, and 2) it's impossible not to feel like people will doubt you or simply conclude that you made poor relationship decisions somehow. While I don't want to minimise the caregiving challenges of someone looking after a loved one with cancer or another serious physical health issue, at least you can be sure that only the worst of humanity will treat it like a non-problem if you tell them what's happening."	1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--60900a31edc8e237c0dd605c	00016b18b2--60900a31edc8e237c0dd605c	APPROVED

"This is left over from old times when a wife not having had sex before marriage was the only way to ""ensure"" she wasn't already pregnant from someone else and you wouldn't invest scarce resources into someone else's genes. Because viginity tests are sooo reliable. Now that we have paternity tests and proper contraception, it's no loger necessary and there is really no need for purity and innocence in sexual contexts. I think it speaks volumes about a man if he wants a pure or innocent girl (let's be real: they don't want women, they want girls), and women shouldn't fall for that anymore."	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--60900a674b93044d50715392	00016b18b2--60900a674b93044d50715392	APPROVED
Once I argued with my mom about how woman should be prepared with enough self defense to everything evertime and she labeled me as a misogynist. And I feel so foolish and wrong about my past self. And I despise even the people who inherits same opinion as my past self but I despise even more the people are sexist and blaming victims. Just remind your sexist friend that there are people out there who is ready to go rape or murder but they just cant do in public because of laws and afraid of being caught more than doing it and this is not okay or normal either. We are not in a jungle with wild animals anymore so why we should fear to go outside at night? Even I can be anxious when I am the last alone passenger at night even though Im very tall. I avoid to follow woman or passing her without even getting near to not to make her afraid because she can think Im stalking. To just emphatise I think about what peoples worst act on every possible situation if I were woman, because its what society expects to do for woman but its just terryfying.	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--60900a674b93044d50715392	00016b18b2--60900a674b93044d50715392	APPROVED

I have seen this perspective in a few different subreddits in a few different comment sections. I'm interested in diving into it further (pulling out my Ebscohost access and everything!), but I'm struggling to find much around which rights are typically referred to here. My vague recollection of what the premise of this argument would be is that brain dead people are not required to sustain the life of another individual whereas pregnant persons would be with restricted abortion access. Is this more about organ donation after brain death or conjoined twin situations? Or is it about some other corpse-rights situation? I've had a few false starts and just need to be pointed in the right direction on where to dive in.	1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--60900a674b93044d50715392	00016b18b2--60900a674b93044d50715392	APPROVED

Isn't it because it's gendered? Pointlessly gendered as the sub would say.There's the trope you identify, about undermining a woman that speaks out, because a woman speaking out is of itself unacceptable.Then there's the identification of the unreasonableness of the complaint in a gendered name. But both men and women are unreasonable, make silly complaints, are thoughtless. But only when a woman does it is that person called a Karen. (Altho actually, i think i have once seen a man referred to as being a Karen. But in some ways that was even worse, since it demanded that certain traits be seen as necessarily female...)The mistake lies in that, almost always in my experience, the criticism against the Karen is valid. But that doesn't mean we have to be sexist in calling it out. I don't use the term. Disclosure time. I identify as a man. Please excuse/forgive if this therefore constitutes mansplaining.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--60900d106b43067ad4a2d184	00016b18b2--60900d106b43067ad4a2d184	APPROVED

People can do what they want, but I have a serious problem with this sort of thing when it's called feminism. Sexualizing yourself is your right, but it's certainly not feminist and you're still contributing to the objectification and sexualization of women as a whole. I understand that you could consider making a fortune off of straight male sexuality some sort of empowering, but you're also pandering to the patriarchy in the process. As you said, it's none of my business what people choose to do with their body, but as a feminist, I'm going to criticize this trend and what it means for women without attacking the individual woman. I especially think this is damaging to young girls and teenagers who are now being thought that empowerment comes from showing off as much of their body as possible and all that matters is how popular you are on social media. I don't have a TikTok, but I've read some horror stories of pedophilia on there with adult men convincing pre-pubescent girls to twerk for them and these girls thinking it's fine because they see the likes of Cardi B do the same thing on TV.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--60900d106b43067ad4a2d184	00016b18b2--60900d106b43067ad4a2d184	APPROVED

"Individual accounts, though often anecdotal, help comprise a working pattern of how men are treated. Any true story is worth hearing and understanding in order to protect one's person. I believe dumping is equally valid, because where else do men truly get to vent? I have yet to find a real world place to talk openly about  issues men face? Why? Many people either don't believe, don't care, or also hate men.Feminism has huge leverage, and one can readily find phrases such as ""kill all men"" or other legitimate hate speech aimed at destroying men. If ever this place became a dumping ground against women, their actions, and the legal/social bias against men, I would still support it. We can collectively share, learn, expose those who actively try to harm, and hopefully grow stronger. To have that sort of bond requires real stories from people's lives, as I know of nobody who develops a bond over statistics.Should it be complaining without a goal? No. Complain, find help, draw strength, continue on and keep trying to fix what can be fixed. Sometimes, things also aren't fixable due to how rigged society is (mental health being severely gate-kept from men in my experience), and we can still seek social help, educate, etc.Social forums or situations aren't static;they ebb and flow. This sub will, too. But, let men complain, let them vent, and let them ease their anger in a better setting than they otherwise have."	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--60900e530b14ef5c4fdee2ae	00016b18b2--60900e530b14ef5c4fdee2ae	APPROVED

"In Bavaria (province of Germany), it was recently decided that we are to wear FFP2 masks instead of community masks in public transport and supermarkets. The decision was made against the recommendation of the Robert Koch Institute, which is a government agency that researches disease control and prevention.The reasoning of our Minister-President, Markus Söder, is that the FFP2 masks will prevent an infection for the carrier of the mask as well as for their environment. That is true, if the mask is worn correctly.However, when I, a woman, wear a standard FFP2 mask, it is too big for my face. The mask is gaping at the chin and nose, even when using one of those masks with a metallic strip in it. Today, I noticed that I am not the only woman with this problem. The masks are gaping for all women I saw, while they do not gape for men. With my FFP2 mask, I am practically raw dogging train air. With the community mask I sewed myself, I never had this problem.My assumption is that the size of the masks are standardized to fit onto men's faces, as so many things are in our world. I am now stuck with buying special FFP2 masks made for my face, which will cost me more money. Friendly reminder here that women are, on average, much poorer than men due to a lot of women's work being unpaid and/or underpaid.I can practically see already how in two weeks, headlines will read ""Women in Bavaria are having way higher Covid numbers than men! Why are women being so careless and irresponsible?!"".In case you want to read more about it: https://themunicheye.com/ffp2-masks-now-compulsory-on-public-transport-3913EDIT: I am not against wearing a mask. I want the proper fitting masks available for women at the same price as the men's masks, and I want my government to listen to the scientists."	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--60900fc7dd05ff4c5a35cc4a	00016b18b2--60900fc7dd05ff4c5a35cc4a	APPROVED

Sexual abuse and childhood neglect. I’m glad he felt comfortable and vulnerable enough to share it with me. His parents were young and not focused on caring for my SO and his younger brother. He would have to steal food from the grocery store. I used to think that made me the saddest until he finally asked his mom if his dad ever held a gun to her head. He had. My SO was four years old at the time. He’s carried it silently with him until just about a month ago. So much trauma for a little boy. We’re having our first baby in a few moths- a little boy. I know he’s going to give our son all the love he had missed out on as a child. It’s part of his love towards me. He sees how nurturing and caring I am with him and others around me. And I’m the same with him, I always lacked a protector and I know he would do anything to keep our family safe. He’s grown into a wonderful man despite his hardships.	1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--60901b216efd841d657b2f8a	00016b18b2--60901b216efd841d657b2f8a	APPROVED

"Caring for a partner or family member with a mental health issue, because it's not something you can often talk about fully with that person. There's a thin line between sharing your honest feelings and inadvertently making a person with clinical depression or thoughts of self harm feel even more like a burden -- not exactly what you want to do.There's just very little practical information or support for the day to day issues of caregiving, especially where mental health is concerned. What do you say or do when someone you love is having a panic attack? Expressing suicidal thoughts at 3am on a Wednesday? How do you help ensure a fellow adult takes extremely necessary medication consistently if they struggle with routines and patterns? How do you balance all of this with a demanding job and being the primary manager of all household labour? What does it do to your own mental health, and how can you balance the functional responsibilities of caregiving with the responsibilities of your own health, mental or physical? Who knows? Maybe you can figure it all out with the three 30min ""well-being"" hotline sessions your employer allocates each year? The stigma around mental health is a huge issue, primarily for helping people manage their own and to seek help when they need it. But the secondary impact is that caregivers *also* feel ashamed and secretive, because 1) it may not feel like their own issue to 'share' with others, especially mutual friends and acquaintances, and 2) it's impossible not to feel like people will doubt you or simply conclude that you made poor relationship decisions somehow. While I don't want to minimise the caregiving challenges of someone looking after a loved one with cancer or another serious physical health issue, at least you can be sure that only the worst of humanity will treat it like a non-problem if you tell them what's happening."	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--60901b928342200cc3079dde	00016b18b2--60901b928342200cc3079dde	APPROVED

*Image Transcription: Image and text*---\[*Black and white image of Annie Lee Cooper's face looking proud*]Ini 1963, Annie Lee Cooper tried to register to vote, and was fired from her job because of it. In 1965, she tried again, waiting in line for hours. The sheriff ordered her to leave, prodding her in the neck with a billy club, until she turned around and punched him in the jaw, knocking him to the ground. After being jailed, she became a registered voter. Following the Voting Rights Act, the sheriff was voted out. Annie Lee Cooper lived to be 100. The sheriff was eventually jailed for conspiring to smuggle drugs. ---^^I'm&#32;a&#32;human&#32;volunteer&#32;content&#32;transcriber&#32;for&#32;Reddit&#32;and&#32;you&#32;could&#32;be&#32;too!&#32;[If&#32;you'd&#32;like&#32;more&#32;information&#32;on&#32;what&#32;we&#32;do&#32;and&#32;why&#32;we&#32;do&#32;it,&#32;click&#32;here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit/wiki/index)	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--60901bde7a19413e31870a72	00016b18b2--60901bde7a19413e31870a72	APPROVED

"There is a radical Feminist artist collective called 'claire fontaine' after a popular French brand of notebooks who make artwork dealing with Feminist and capitalist topics.   Here is their website: https://www.clairefontaine.ws/   And here is their letter to the visitor: https://www.clairefontaine.ws/index  There is also the O.G. French Feminist Simone de Beauvoir whose major work ""The Second Sex"" set the stage for contemporary discussions of gender theory.    Another prominent French Feminist is Luce Irigaray who works on language within the framework of analysis of phallocentrism as well as analysis through a Marxist framework of Feminist topics and critiques of a range of philosophers and their thought through a critical Feminist lens.   Julia Kristeva and Hélène Cixous are also prominent French Feminist thinkers whose work falls within postructuralism (and also structuralism in Krisreva's case). Kristeva deals with literary theory and critique as well as semiotics (within linguistics the study of signs, signifiers, and the signified) among others. Cixous is associated with Derrida (they published a book together) and her work deals with language and communication and how they interrelate with sexuality among other topics.

Husband cheated. Two kids. I did the pick me dance (Gross, I know).  Didn’t want my kids coming from a divorced home like I did.  Stayed with him, refused to check up on him, gave him 100% of my trust.  Accidentally caught him trying to reach out to her again, of course he denied.  Still I struggled, I knew once I made the decision to go there was no turning back. (if I didn’t have kids I could’ve made that decision in a heartbeat and the first time). Prayed to God to show me a sign to tell me if I should stay or go.  Kept seeing things and didn’t know if they were the signs. Screamed at God to show me a sign that I could not ignore. The next day or so, my daughter called me at work to tell me he had hit my son who was 11.  I came home so his handprint on my sons ass and that was when I decided, “I can’t do this anymore“.I called the lawyer, started the divorce proceedings and moved out with my kids.	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--6090387c0f8c700461940279	00016b18b2--6090387c0f8c700461940279	APPROVED

Isn't it because it's gendered? Pointlessly gendered as the sub would say.There's the trope you identify, about undermining a woman that speaks out, because a woman speaking out is of itself unacceptable.Then there's the identification of the unreasonableness of the complaint in a gendered name. But both men and women are unreasonable, make silly complaints, are thoughtless. But only when a woman does it is that person called a Karen. (Altho actually, i think i have once seen a man referred to as being a Karen. But in some ways that was even worse, since it demanded that certain traits be seen as necessarily female...)The mistake lies in that, almost always in my experience, the criticism against the Karen is valid. But that doesn't mean we have to be sexist in calling it out. I don't use the term. Disclosure time. I identify as a man. Please excuse/forgive if this therefore constitutes mansplaining.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609039e79fe36f17d7c8a756	00016b18b2--609039e79fe36f17d7c8a756	APPROVED

People can do what they want, but I have a serious problem with this sort of thing when it's called feminism. Sexualizing yourself is your right, but it's certainly not feminist and you're still contributing to the objectification and sexualization of women as a whole. I understand that you could consider making a fortune off of straight male sexuality some sort of empowering, but you're also pandering to the patriarchy in the process. As you said, it's none of my business what people choose to do with their body, but as a feminist, I'm going to criticize this trend and what it means for women without attacking the individual woman. I especially think this is damaging to young girls and teenagers who are now being thought that empowerment comes from showing off as much of their body as possible and all that matters is how popular you are on social media. I don't have a TikTok, but I've read some horror stories of pedophilia on there with adult men convincing pre-pubescent girls to twerk for them and these girls thinking it's fine because they see the likes of Cardi B do the same thing on TV.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609039e79fe36f17d7c8a756	00016b18b2--609039e79fe36f17d7c8a756	APPROVED

I’m tired too and I’m only 20. You just gotta remember why you’re a feminist, where would we be without feminists. When women first started to fight against misogyny all they saw was these men you described and worse. Most men (and even some women) thought they were crazy and ridiculous, FOR HAVING THE SAME IDEALS WE STILL HAVE TODAY. I’m tired but I consider myself lucky to be able to carry on what our sisters started for us. I know  that when they got tired they didn’t stop. For that reason alone I KNOW that even if we feel like we’re getting no where, in the future when we’re all gone and things have changed because WE didn’t stop when we got tired, our mothers, daughters, sister and especially our trans women will be safe and free. That alone is how and why we can’t stop. If you believe you as a woman shouldn’t feel scared, ripped off, judged, forced to do something or humiliated ect. just because you’re a woman, then you’re a feminist. That’s all it is and anyone who can’t understand that isn’t worth your breath.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--60903a40ca4cce13cb2b711f	00016b18b2--60903a40ca4cce13cb2b711f	APPROVED

In 1965, she tried again, waiting in line for hours. The sheriff ordered her to leave, prodding her in the neck with a billy club, until she turned around and punched him in the jaw, knocking him to the ground. After being jailed, she became a registered voter. Following the Voting Rights Act, the sheriff was voted out. Annie Lee Cooper lived to be 100. The sheriff was eventually jailed for conspiring to smuggle drugs. ---^^I'm&#32;a&#32;human&#32;volunteer&#32;content&#32;transcriber&#32;for&#32;Reddit&#32;and&#32;you&#32;could&#32;be&#32;too!&#32;[If&#32;you'd&#32;like&#32;more&#32;information&#32;on&#32;what&#32;we&#32;do&#32;and&#32;why&#32;we&#32;do&#32;it,&#32;click&#32;here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit/wiki/index)	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--60903a965614113712efaf20	00016b18b2--60903a965614113712efaf20	APPROVED

If a woman chose of her own free will to go around telling all other women that they should be submissive because that is women's natural role in life, is that a feminist choice?  Is she acting as a feminist?When women scream at other women as they go and try to access abortion services, is that a feminist choice?When women shame other women for immodesty, shame other women for being raped, shame other women for being sexually active, are those feminist choices?Choosing to have a career or choosing to shave your legs don't necessarily have anything to do with feminism.

"There is a radical Feminist artist collective called 'claire fontaine' after a popular French brand of notebooks who make artwork dealing with Feminist and capitalist topics.   Here is their website: https://www.clairefontaine.ws/   And here is their letter to the visitor: https://www.clairefontaine.ws/index  There is also the O.G. French Feminist Simone de Beauvoir whose major work ""The Second Sex"" set the stage for contemporary discussions of gender theory.    Another prominent French Feminist is Luce Irigaray who works on language within the framework of analysis of phallocentrism as well as analysis through a Marxist framework of Feminist topics and critiques of a range of philosophers and their thought through a critical Feminist lens.   Julia Kristeva and Hélène Cixous are also prominent French Feminist thinkers whose work falls within postructuralism (and also structuralism in Krisreva's case). Kristeva deals with literary theory and critique as well as semiotics (within linguistics the study of signs, signifiers, and the signified) among others. Cixous is associated with Derrida (they published a book together) and her work deals with language and communication and how they interrelate with sexuality among other topics.

Sexual abuse and childhood neglect. I’m glad he felt comfortable and vulnerable enough to share it with me. His parents were young and not focused on caring for my SO and his younger brother. He would have to steal food from the grocery store. I used to think that made me the saddest until he finally asked his mom if his dad ever held a gun to her head. He had. My SO was four years old at the time. He’s carried it silently with him until just about a month ago. So much trauma for a little boy. We’re having our first baby in a few moths- a little boy. I know he’s going to give our son all the love he had missed out on as a child. It’s part of his love towards me. He sees how nurturing and caring I am with him and others around me. And I’m the same with him, I always lacked a protector and I know he would do anything to keep our family safe. He’s grown into a wonderful man despite his hardships.	1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--60903b379d36706924e5259b	00016b18b2--60903b379d36706924e5259b	APPROVED

"In Bavaria (province of Germany), it was recently decided that we are to wear FFP2 masks instead of community masks in public transport and supermarkets. The decision was made against the recommendation of the Robert Koch Institute, which is a government agency that researches disease control and prevention.The reasoning of our Minister-President, Markus Söder, is that the FFP2 masks will prevent an infection for the carrier of the mask as well as for their environment. That is true, if the mask is worn correctly.However, when I, a woman, wear a standard FFP2 mask, it is too big for my face. The mask is gaping at the chin and nose, even when using one of those masks with a metallic strip in it. Today, I noticed that I am not the only woman with this problem. The masks are gaping for all women I saw, while they do not gape for men. With my FFP2 mask, I am practically raw dogging train air. With the community mask I sewed myself, I never had this problem.My assumption is that the size of the masks are standardized to fit onto men's faces, as so many things are in our world. I am now stuck with buying special FFP2 masks made for my face, which will cost me more money. Friendly reminder here that women are, on average, much poorer than men due to a lot of women's work being unpaid and/or underpaid.I can practically see already how in two weeks, headlines will read ""Women in Bavaria are having way higher Covid numbers than men! Why are women being so careless and irresponsible?!"".In case you want to read more about it: https://themunicheye.com/ffp2-masks-now-compulsory-on-public-transport-3913EDIT: I am not against wearing a mask.

We've been together for 4 years :3Note: I also accept my bf the way he is and I support his hobbies and listen to him when he needs to vent or has a problem.	1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--60903dec04eb6219ecd1a9e9	00016b18b2--60903dec04eb6219ecd1a9e9	APPROVED

We appreciate your participation on r/WitchesVsPatriarchy. Unfortunately, this particular post has been removed in an effort to better curate our content and reinforce the aspects of this sub that make it unique. /r/WitchesVsPatriarchy is a woman-centered sub with a witchy twist, aimed at healing, supporting, and uplifting one another through humor and magic. It's not mandatory for posts to have both a witchy theme and a feminist theme. However our goal is to become a haven from hatred online, so we especially value posts that have a positive/uplifting or humorous vibe. Posts calling out or taking shots at other groups are discouraged unless they implicitly offer a remedy. While we deeply understand the value of calling out groups for harmful behavior, there are other existing subs better suited for that type of content. We hope you understand and continue to participate within our guidelines 🙂

This kind of cognitive dissonance is always going to exist unfortunately. Though it's an interesting point you make about Latin America, lots of that news seems to have been really poorly spread, I hadn't heard of this at all and nobody I speak to had either. Meanwhile we all know about the toxic extremes of so-called feminism that's always going on. This is part of the problem, it used to be that people's reactions would pass this kind of news along, but now it seems media outlets are leading with these stories for more profit and interest while the actual important stuff goes a little more unnoticed.You'll find that people and platforms who identify as Egalitarian rather than Feminist are much better and give more shits about real issues. Someone who only believes they should stand for the rights of their own demographic and not everyone is gonna be problematic sooner or later.	1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--60903eae9fe36f17d7c91009	00016b18b2--60903eae9fe36f17d7c91009	APPROVED

I didn't realize anyone in the western world liked school tbh... I went to school in the 90s/early 20s and it was always fucking terrible.

I believe there was an exhibit in either Ireland or the U.K. that put the clothes that rape victims were wearing (during their assault) on display.

I would reconsider having these people as your “friends.”These people should be reported to the dean/principal at your school or university so they will be reprimanded or likely expelled for creating unsafe environment and sexual assault.

Another example of mens sexuality being demonized. Men like to see naked women, if you are dressed provocatively, you should expect to be looked at.

To be fair, and I hate to be, to the participants in these posts. They are partially right. The problem is that word 'partially.'Women are at a disadvantage when it comes to physical aggression.  It doesn’t mean they can't or won't do it, but simply due to the fact that men are larger and have more upper body muscle mass, it makes such cases different. For instance, there is an increasing body of work that show women are at least as likely to physically abuse men, but men are far more likely to inflict severe physical injury when abusing women.Women also tend to be specialists at forms of abuse that, while there are men that do such, as a whole you will find men are simply not as 'gifted' there. I am specifically referring to verbal and mental abuse. In essence the sexes, while both engaging in the area the other specializes in, tend to move to specific types of abuse based on general predilections that are true generally if not for every case.Minimizing the damaging effects of either type of abuse is both dangerous and irresponsible.	1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--60903eff5549355605f7a43e	00016b18b2--60903eff5549355605f7a43e	APPROVED

It's not mandatory for posts to have both a witchy theme and a feminist theme. However our goal is to become a haven from hatred online, so we especially value posts that have a positive/uplifting or humorous vibe. Posts calling out or taking shots at other groups are discouraged unless they implicitly offer a remedy. While we deeply understand the value of calling out groups for harmful behavior, there are other existing subs better suited for that type of content.

Article:President Joe Biden has only been in office for less than a day, but he’s already busy undoing some of his predecessor’s legacy by firing some very awful people and issuing a spree of executive orders. We truly love to see it! In a sign that Biden is doing something right, one of the executive orders he issued on Wednesday night has pissed off a cohort of some of the worst people in the world—TERFs and other supposed feminists who have made it their mission in life in recent years to loudly fight the expansion of trans rights. Meant to tackle “discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation,” Biden’s executive order essentially calls on federal agencies to broadly apply last year’s landmark Bostock ruling, which expanded the definition of sex discrimination to include discrimination based on sexual orientation as well as gender identity. Notably, the executive order included the line, “Children should be able to learn without worrying about whether they will be denied access to the restroom, the locker room, or school sports,” and stated that Bostock should also apply to Title IX, the federal law that prohibits discrimination in federally funded schools.This has major implications for trans students, and signals an extremely welcome shift after the Trump administration, which marshaled the considerable resources of the federal government to make the lives of trans people as mean and limited as it possibly could. “It is such a relief to have a government that is committed to preventing discrimination as opposed to enabling it,” wrote the ACLU’s James Esseks, the director of the group’s LGBT & HIV Project, in a statement in response to the executive order. As the National Women’s Law Center’s Gillian Branstetter told Jezebel via email, Biden’s executive order “is a critical recognition of both last summer’s [Bostock] Supreme Court victory and the right of every person to learn, labor, and live without fear of prejudice or bias.”BIDEN, THEY CROAKED, IS “ERASING WOMEN.”But the move hit differently for all those who have spent recent years cloaking their transphobia in a shallow concern for women and girls. Biden, they croaked, is “erasing women.”The Women’s Liberation Front, or WoLF, a small group of so-called “radical feminists” who have partnered with the religious right to campaign against trans rights, wrote that Biden’s executive order “is a disaster for women and girls in the U.S.” and an “unprecedented attack on women’s rights and civil liberties.” Abigail Shrier, the writer whose book title—Irreversible Damage: The Transgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters—tells you all you need to know about her, jumped in with her own hyperbolic take, which was retweeted widely. “A new glass ceiling was just placed over girls,” warned Shrier darkly, adding that the executive order “unilaterally eviscerates women’s sports.” Even the Brits decided to weigh in; in a since-deleted tweet, the writer Hadley Freeman bemoaned that Biden’s move was “terrible,” adding later that it “will kill women’s sport.”That this fretting is actually anti-trans fearmongering hidden under the guise of a warped and outdated notion of feminism should be apparent. But the handwringing does, in its own way, acknowledge the potential repercussions that Biden’s executive order represents. As many have noted, it may give the many Republican legislators who are pushing bills targeting trans high school athletes a bit of pause, given that Biden’s executive order signals that the Department of Education may move to revoke federal funds from states that pass discriminatory laws against trans students. As the ACLU’s Chase Strangio put it, commenting on Montana’s bill being debated on Thursday that would bar trans girls from athletics, “The legislature is playing games with the state’s education system to attack trans young people.” He added, “Right now lawmakers are not only voting on trans lives but threatening the state’s federal funding.” Financial consequences, after all, seem to be the only ones that bigoted state lawmakers ever care about.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--60903f8dd95ac73c354a7e10	00016b18b2--60903f8dd95ac73c354a7e10	APPROVED

My brother just got back from uni recently, I haven’t seen him in 7 months because of covid (and I’m pretty thankful for it. While we were having dinner tonight he said something about how teenage girls are always bitchy and insecure, I noted that that’s only how they’re painted as cause everything they like is seen as either basic or fake. My tone and pitch were constant and I was saying it lightheartedly and yet he still started acting like I was screaming at him for it. He made a motion to ‘calm me down’ with his hands and even exclaimed ‘Jesus Christ’ as if I’d been yelling. He does this every time I express an opinion, even if it doesn’t mean anything. During the same meal he did this when I answered that the reason there were so many flies was because we were eating outside.Even when we were younger he would tell me to butt out of discussions because ‘it didn’t involve me’ even if it directly did. At that time I could never understand why, I’ve realised now it’s because he doesn’t take me or my opinions seriously. Everything I say he acts like is unreasonable or an overreaction. I’ve been constantly checking myself around him for our entire lives. I never even noticed until he left and I saw the difference. He may be my brother, but I have no respect for him because of the way he acts. I made this post because I wanted to ask if anybody had any similar experiences. Not being taken seriously is a very important and dismissive attitude that is often put aside in light of more serious sexist behaviours.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--60903f8dd95ac73c354a7e10	00016b18b2--60903f8dd95ac73c354a7e10	APPROVED
The WEF https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Economic_Forum released a report showing that gender equality has still not been reached in many countries, including western ones. The US ranked 53rd, below Zimbabwe. https://abcnews.go.com/Business/us-ranked-lower-zimbabwe-gender-equality-year-low/story?id=67775137  The UK ranked 21st and Australia ranked 44 globally.According to many reports it will take between 100 and 257 years to reach global gender equality.The WEF ranks equality based on health, education, economy and politics.One of the reasons that the US ranks so badly is maternal mortality rates and lack of any kind of maternity/paternity leave. Meaning any woman who gives birth in the US will suffer severe economic consequences.We all know that feminism is need globally but we must not let people tell us that it isn’t needed in the west because equality has already been reached.Remember the Equal Rights Amendment has never been ratified unto the constitution. Meaning that equal rights in America are granted on a state level and vary state by state. https://www.security.org/resources/best-worst-states-womens-rights/  The act is designed to guarantee equal legal rights for all American citizens regardless of sex.Feminism still has a lot of work to do.	1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--60903f8dd95ac73c354a7e10	00016b18b2--60903f8dd95ac73c354a7e10	APPROVED

Another example of mens sexuality being demonized. Men like to see naked women, if you are dressed provocatively, you should expect to be looked at.

Men should be held at the same standards, ie, we shouldn't be allowed to wear pants that show our penis.	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--6090403cd159ef4ffa47d046	00016b18b2--6090403cd159ef4ffa47d046	APPROVED

To be fair, and I hate to be, to the participants in these posts. They are partially right. The problem is that word 'partially.'Women are at a disadvantage when it comes to physical aggression.  It doesn’t mean they can't or won't do it, but simply due to the fact that men are larger and have more upper body muscle mass, it makes such cases different. For instance, there is an increasing body of work that show women are at least as likely to physically abuse men, but men are far more likely to inflict severe physical injury when abusing women.Women also tend to be specialists at forms of abuse that, while there are men that do such, as a whole you will find men are simply not as 'gifted' there. I am specifically referring to verbal and mental abuse. In essence the sexes, while both engaging in the area the other specializes in, tend to move to specific types of abuse based on general predilections that are true generally if not for every case.Minimizing the damaging effects of either type of abuse is both dangerous and irresponsible.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--6090403cd159ef4ffa47d046	00016b18b2--6090403cd159ef4ffa47d046	APPROVED

I’m confused, in the quote of the law it never states gender.

You can spend your time reporting and blocking people, but if you really care (and you do) and have any sort of energy and ressources, spend every angry emotion and inner rants against these sexist men, to sign petitions, write articles and thought pieces, give suggestions to magazines on current women's issues. Take part in real life feminism, or volunteer for online activism; become a prominent person on a woman's rights website. Know that while these men spew anger on subreddits, you will shift the prominence of real life women and their rights. You are strengthening movements, while they are (ineffectively) strengthening their own reactionary mindsets; not even 20 men of these types, will get anything done, compared to just one moderately activist woman.Fight for women - and fight for yourself.

I'm not gonna judge you for it and I definitely think that a big part of feminism is letting women use their bodies as they please because they own it, though I do think selling pictures of your body or selling your own body just contributes to the idea that women are an object and that consent has a price. I totally understand tho, that some women do it to survive and that it is a way to get extra money and sometimes you can't think of the negative effects it has on society cause you just need the money, so thinking about it deeply and technically I'd say that you can do what you want with your body thanks to feminism, but using it for money is not contributing to actual feminism, tho no one should judge you for it	1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--60904206ca4cce13cb2c1a8c	00016b18b2--60904206ca4cce13cb2c1a8c	APPROVED

"Karen Straughan's response to ""those aren't real feminists""*The following is a very informed and highly reusable  comment by Karen Straughan in response to a feminist who thinks the many blatant sexists among feminists aren't real feminists:* So what you're saying is that you, a commenter using a username on an internet forum are the true feminist, and the feminists actually responsible for changing the laws, writing the academic theory, teaching the courses, influencing the public policies, and the massive, well-funded feminist organizations with thousands and thousands of members all of whom call themselves feminists... they are not ""real feminists"".That's not just ""no true Scotsman"". That's delusional self deception.Listen, if you want to call yourself a feminist, I don't care. I've been investigating feminism for more than 9 years now, and people like you used to piss me off, because to my mind all you were doing was providing cover and ballast for the powerful political and academic feminists you claim are just jerks. And believe me, they ARE jerks. If you knew half of what I know about the things they've done under the banner of feminism, maybe you'd stop calling yourself one.But I want you to know. You don't matter. You're not the director of the Feminist Majority Foundation and editor of Ms. Magazine, Katherine Spillar, who said of domestic violence: ""Well, that's just a clean-up word for wife-beating,"" and went on to add that regarding male victims of dating violence, ""we know it's not girls beating up boys, it's boys beating up girls.""You're not Jan Reimer, former mayor of Edmonton and long-time head of Alberta's Network of Women's Shelters, who just a few years ago refused to appear on a TV program discussing male victims of domestic violence, because for her to even show up and discuss it would lend legitimacy to the idea that they exist.You're not Mary P Koss, who describes male victims of female rapists in her academic papers as being not rape victims because they were ""ambivalent about their sexual desires"" (if you don't know what that means, it's that they actually wanted it), and then went on to define them out of the definition of rape in the CDC's research because it's inappropriate to consider what happened to them rape.You're not the National Organization for Women, and its associated legal foundations, who lobbied to replace the gender neutral federal Family Violence Prevention and Services Act of 1984 with the obscenely gendered Violence Against Women Act of 1994. The passing of that law cut male victims out of support services and legal assistance in more than 60 passages, just because they were male.You're not the Florida chapter of the NOW, who successfully lobbied to have Governor Rick Scott veto not one, but two alimony reform bills in the last ten years, bills that had passed both houses with overwhelming bipartisan support, and were supported by more than 70% of the electorate.You're not the feminist group in Maryland who convinced every female member of the House on both sides of the aisle to walk off the floor when a shared parenting bill came up for a vote, meaning the quorum could not be met and the bill died then and there.You're not the feminists in Canada agitating to remove sexual assault from the normal criminal courts, into quasi-criminal courts of equity where the burden of proof would be lowered, the defendant could be compelled to testify, discovery would go both ways, and defendants would not be entitled to a public defender.You're not Professor Elizabeth Sheehy, who wrote a book advocating that women not only have the right to murder their husbands without fear of prosecution if they make a claim of abuse, but that they have the moral responsibility to murder their husbands.You're not the feminist legal scholars and advocates who successfully changed rape laws such that a woman's history of making multiple false allegations of rape can be excluded from evidence at trial because it's ""part of her sexual history.""You're not the feminists who splattered the media with the false claim that putting your penis in a passed-out woman's mouth is ""not a crime"" in Oklahoma, because the prosecutor was incompetent and charged the defendant under an inappropriate statute (forcible sodomy) and the higher court refused to expand the definition of that statute beyond its intended scope when there was already a perfectly good one (sexual battery) already there. You're not the idiot feminists lying to the public and potentially putting women in Oklahoma at risk by telling potential offenders there's a ""legal"" way to rape them.And you're none of the hundreds or thousands of feminist scholars, writers, thinkers, researchers, teachers and philosophers who constructed and propagate the body of bunkum theories upon which all of these atrocities are based.You're the true feminist. Some random person on the internet."	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609042c75b31ab7f1c97b798	00016b18b2--609042c75b31ab7f1c97b798	APPROVED
You messed up badly.First off, C's behavior was inappropriate, whether it was consensual or not. To be frank with you, you have no idea what her relationship with everyone else is. For all you know, they may all be great friends, completely fine with her doing that. She never touched you so you weren't part of her circle of friends.With that said, touching other people like that at work, even if they consent, is **not acceptable workplace behavior.** Even if she only touched one person around the office like that, and that person happened to be her husband, she should be reprimanded for creating a hostile work environment for other people.But dude... come on. You actually touched her ass? What the hell were you thinking? This is beyond her being a feminist, a woman, or anything else. You jumped in on the little game they were playing without invitation and naturally she got pissed off at you. My wife is allowed to reach down my pants and play with my balls if she wants; this doesn't mean random women on the street are.I'm not surprised they didn't even want your 30 days notice. This isn't an MRM issue. This isn't a double standard. This is you misreading a situation and frankly being incredibly socially awkward.	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609042c75b31ab7f1c97b798	00016b18b2--609042c75b31ab7f1c97b798	APPROVED

Remember the #believeHer slogan? That if a woman says she was raped you have to believe her?I have a better one. **#DontBeliveHer!** It is innocent until proven guilty! No man deserves to lose his reputation over a false accusation. And it boils my blood that when women are caught lying about rape, they are not punished, their reputation not destroyed. They don't get raped or beaten up in prison. And they get to continue their life like it was nothing.Fuck this shit. If I'm ever accused by someone and law fails to give them the exact same punishment they would give me, I will take matters in my own hands.**#DONTBELIVEHER** There has been too many lives destroyed by the law allowing women to take revenge on innocent men.

Guys:> Simply being uncomfortable with the conclusions of a published paper, would and should not lead to retraction on this basis alone.

I’m confused, in the quote of the law it never states gender. All the things that make it easier for a woman to not get a rape sentence, or as heavy a one, have to deal with societal norms not the actual law.

I suggest you email them and ask them if the figure they use indicates any discrimination or unfairness.I did that here in New Zealand and they confirmed that the figure cannot show unfairness because they don't take 'equal work' into consideration.

I believe there was an exhibit in either Ireland or the U.K. that put the clothes that rape victims were wearing (during their assault) on display. These were ranging from large winter jackets to work attire to nightclub dresses. The most haunting was set of children’s pajamas. It’s not the clothes. It has never been about the clothes. There is only ever one party responsible for rape and it’s the assaulting party.

I would reconsider having these people as your “friends.”These people should be reported to the dean/principal at your school or university so they will be reprimanded or likely expelled for creating unsafe environment and sexual assault. I don’t need to “understand” anything about why these pos are doing what they are doing, as a feminist it is our duty to report these types of behaviors and do something about it. If you won’t, I will be more than happy if you pm me and give me the contact information of your school if u live in the u.s and I can do it for you. I could care less about what my reputation signifies to these losers. What’s important here is the safety of young women and girls who aren’t able to get a good education because of idiots like this. This type of behavior should never be tolerated anywhere.	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609043ce9fe36f17d7c96b81	00016b18b2--609043ce9fe36f17d7c96b81	APPROVED

I was valedictorian in elementary, middle, and was on the path until junior year of high school.

"The thing with crimes is that we never know how many were committed. It's called the ""black number"" it refers to all the crimes committed that were not reported to the police.Sexual assault is considered to be the crime with the highest black number because it's so taboo. Since metoo we saw a rise in the amount of registered sexual assault, not because men were commiting more but because it was less taboo (for women) to report. Now we have a different problem, since society sees sexual assault as a women only issue, men are not taken seriously when they report that they themselves were victims, some men get raped but don't report because they got brainwashed into thinking that men can't be raped. People use this to say ""see, they're so many more female victims of sexual assault, so the problem is men"". The reality is more complicated, it is reasonable to think that more women gets sexually assaulted but it could be a proportion of 80/20 or even 60/40, we won't know until more studies goes out. But obviously, studies about male victims of sexual assault don't get a lot of funding.Also, I'm talking here about official criminal statistics, a lot of feminists ""research"" use self-revealed surveys, that often blur the line between sexual harassment and sexual assault. They also tend to give those surveys to populations that are more exposed to those behaviors (young college women, for example) and they generalize to whole study saying that ""it's about ALL women"".Anyways, feminists and society at large would benefit from a class of criminology."	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--6090449c40338e07319a66a7	00016b18b2--6090449c40338e07319a66a7	APPROVED

This kind of cognitive dissonance is always going to exist unfortunately. Though it's an interesting point you make about Latin America, lots of that news seems to have been really poorly spread, I hadn't heard of this at all and nobody I speak to had either. Meanwhile we all know about the toxic extremes of so-called feminism that's always going on. This is part of the problem, it used to be that people's reactions would pass this kind of news along, but now it seems media outlets are leading with these stories for more profit and interest while the actual important stuff goes a little more unnoticed.You'll find that people and platforms who identify as Egalitarian rather than Feminist are much better and give more shits about real issues.

I didn't realize anyone in the western world liked school tbh... I went to school in the 90s/early 20s and it was always fucking terrible.  Most of my teachers were men back then and there was maybe 1 decent one.  All the rest were complete cunts tbh, from a bygone era when they could beat kids.  A lot had trouble transitioning away from that type of control.  So they were very quick to anger.I don't know what men are like in schools now...

"Karen Straughan's response to ""those aren't real feminists""*The following is a very informed and highly reusable  comment by Karen Straughan in response to a feminist who thinks the many blatant sexists among feminists aren't real feminists:* So what you're saying is that you, a commenter using a username on an internet forum are the true feminist, and the feminists actually responsible for changing the laws, writing the academic theory, teaching the courses, influencing the public policies, and the massive, well-funded feminist organizations with thousands and thousands of members all of whom call themselves feminists... they are not ""real feminists"".That's not just ""no true Scotsman"". That's delusional self deception.Listen, if you want to call yourself a feminist, I don't care. I've been investigating feminism for more than 9 years now, and people like you used to piss me off, because to my mind all you were doing was providing cover and ballast for the powerful political and academic feminists you claim are just jerks. And believe me, they ARE jerks. If you knew half of what I know about the things they've done under the banner of feminism, maybe you'd stop calling yourself one.But I want you to know. You don't matter. You're not the director of the Feminist Majority Foundation and editor of Ms. Magazine, Katherine Spillar, who said of domestic violence: ""Well, that's just a clean-up word for wife-beating,"" and went on to add that regarding male victims of dating violence, ""we know it's not girls beating up boys, it's boys beating up girls.""You're not Jan Reimer, former mayor of Edmonton and long-time head of Alberta's Network of Women's Shelters, who just a few years ago refused to appear on a TV program discussing male victims of domestic violence, because for her to even show up and discuss it would lend legitimacy to the idea that they exist.You're not Mary P Koss, who describes male victims of female rapists in her academic papers as being not rape victims because they were ""ambivalent about their sexual desires"" (if you don't know what that means, it's that they actually wanted it), and then went on to define them out of the definition of rape in the CDC's research because it's inappropriate to consider what happened to them rape.You're not the National Organization for Women, and its associated legal foundations, who lobbied to replace the gender neutral federal Family Violence Prevention and Services Act of 1984 with the obscenely gendered Violence Against Women Act of 1994. The passing of that law cut male victims out of support services and legal assistance in more than 60 passages, just because they were male.You're not the Florida chapter of the NOW, who successfully lobbied to have Governor Rick Scott veto not one, but two alimony reform bills in the last ten years, bills that had passed both houses with overwhelming bipartisan support, and were supported by more than 70% of the electorate.You're not the feminist group in Maryland who convinced every female member of the House on both sides of the aisle to walk off the floor when a shared parenting bill came up for a vote, meaning the quorum could not be met and the bill died then and there.You're not the feminists in Canada agitating to remove sexual assault from the normal criminal courts, into quasi-criminal courts of equity where the burden of proof would be lowered, the defendant could be compelled to testify, discovery would go both ways, and defendants would not be entitled to a public defender.You're not Professor Elizabeth Sheehy, who wrote a book advocating that women not only have the right to murder their husbands without fear of prosecution if they make a claim of abuse, but that they have the moral responsibility to murder their husbands.You're not the feminist legal scholars and advocates who successfully changed rape laws such that a woman's history of making multiple false allegations of rape can be excluded from evidence at trial because it's ""part of her sexual history.""You're not the feminists who splattered the media with the false claim that putting your penis in a passed-out woman's mouth is ""not a crime"" in Oklahoma, because the prosecutor was incompetent and charged the defendant under an inappropriate statute (forcible sodomy) and the higher court refused to expand the definition of that statute beyond its intended scope when there was already a perfectly good one (sexual battery) already there. You're not the idiot feminists lying to the public and potentially putting women in Oklahoma at risk by telling potential offenders there's a ""legal"" way to rape them.And you're none of the hundreds or thousands of feminist scholars, writers, thinkers, researchers, teachers and philosophers who constructed and propagate the body of bunkum theories upon which all of these atrocities are based.You're the true feminist.

You messed up badly.First off, C's behavior was inappropriate, whether it was consensual or not. To be frank with you, you have no idea what her relationship with everyone else is. For all you know, they may all be great friends, completely fine with her doing that. She never touched you so you weren't part of her circle of friends.With that said, touching other people like that at work, even if they consent, is **not acceptable workplace behavior.** Even if she only touched one person around the office like that, and that person happened to be her husband, she should be reprimanded for creating a hostile work environment for other people.But dude... come on. You actually touched her ass? What the hell were you thinking? This is beyond her being a feminist, a woman, or anything else. You jumped in on the little game they were playing without invitation and naturally she got pissed off at you. My wife is allowed to reach down my pants and play with my balls if she wants; this doesn't mean random women on the street are.I'm not surprised they didn't even want your 30 days notice.

Article:President Joe Biden has only been in office for less than a day, but he’s already busy undoing some of his predecessor’s legacy by firing some very awful people and issuing a spree of executive orders. We truly love to see it! In a sign that Biden is doing something right, one of the executive orders he issued on Wednesday night has pissed off a cohort of some of the worst people in the world—TERFs and other supposed feminists who have made it their mission in life in recent years to loudly fight the expansion of trans rights. Meant to tackle “discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation,” Biden’s executive order essentially calls on federal agencies to broadly apply last year’s landmark Bostock ruling, which expanded the definition of sex discrimination to include discrimination based on sexual orientation as well as gender identity. Notably, the executive order included the line, “Children should be able to learn without worrying about whether they will be denied access to the restroom, the locker room, or school sports,” and stated that Bostock should also apply to Title IX, the federal law that prohibits discrimination in federally funded schools.This has major implications for trans students, and signals an extremely welcome shift after the Trump administration, which marshaled the considerable resources of the federal government to make the lives of trans people as mean and limited as it possibly could. “It is such a relief to have a government that is committed to preventing discrimination as opposed to enabling it,” wrote the ACLU’s James Esseks, the director of the group’s LGBT & HIV Project, in a statement in response to the executive order. As the National Women’s Law Center’s Gillian Branstetter told Jezebel via email, Biden’s executive order “is a critical recognition of both last summer’s [Bostock] Supreme Court victory and the right of every person to learn, labor, and live without fear of prejudice or bias.”BIDEN, THEY CROAKED, IS “ERASING WOMEN.”But the move hit differently for all those who have spent recent years cloaking their transphobia in a shallow concern for women and girls. Biden, they croaked, is “erasing women.”The Women’s Liberation Front, or WoLF, a small group of so-called “radical feminists” who have partnered with the religious right to campaign against trans rights, wrote that Biden’s executive order “is a disaster for women and girls in the U.S.” and an “unprecedented attack on women’s rights and civil liberties.” Abigail Shrier, the writer whose book title—Irreversible Damage: The Transgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters—tells you all you need to know about her, jumped in with her own hyperbolic take, which was retweeted widely. “A new glass ceiling was just placed over girls,” warned Shrier darkly, adding that the executive order “unilaterally eviscerates women’s sports.” Even the Brits decided to weigh in; in a since-deleted tweet, the writer Hadley Freeman bemoaned that Biden’s move was “terrible,” adding later that it “will kill women’s sport.”That this fretting is actually anti-trans fearmongering hidden under the guise of a warped and outdated notion of feminism should be apparent. But the handwringing does, in its own way, acknowledge the potential repercussions that Biden’s executive order represents. As many have noted, it may give the many Republican legislators who are pushing bills targeting trans high school athletes a bit of pause, given that Biden’s executive order signals that the Department of Education may move to revoke federal funds from states that pass discriminatory laws against trans students. As the ACLU’s Chase Strangio put it, commenting on Montana’s bill being debated on Thursday that would bar trans girls from athletics, “The legislature is playing games with the state’s education system to attack trans young people.” He added, “Right now lawmakers are not only voting on trans lives but threatening the state’s federal funding.” Financial consequences, after all, seem to be the only ones that bigoted state lawmakers ever care about.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--6090476f38310858413dddc2	00016b18b2--6090476f38310858413dddc2	APPROVED

My brother just got back from uni recently, I haven’t seen him in 7 months because of covid (and I’m pretty thankful for it. While we were having dinner tonight he said something about how teenage girls are always bitchy and insecure, I noted that that’s only how they’re painted as cause everything they like is seen as either basic or fake. My tone and pitch were constant and I was saying it lightheartedly and yet he still started acting like I was screaming at him for it. He made a motion to ‘calm me down’ with his hands and even exclaimed ‘Jesus Christ’ as if I’d been yelling. He does this every time I express an opinion, even if it doesn’t mean anything. During the same meal he did this when I answered that the reason there were so many flies was because we were eating outside.Even when we were younger he would tell me to butt out of discussions because ‘it didn’t involve me’ even if it directly did. At that time I could never understand why, I’ve realised now it’s because he doesn’t take me or my opinions seriously. Everything I say he acts like is unreasonable or an overreaction. I’ve been constantly checking myself around him for our entire lives. I never even noticed until he left and I saw the difference. He may be my brother, but I have no respect for him because of the way he acts. I made this post because I wanted to ask if anybody had any similar experiences. Not being taken seriously is a very important and dismissive attitude that is often put aside in light of more serious sexist behaviours.	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--6090476f38310858413dddc2	00016b18b2--6090476f38310858413dddc2	APPROVED
The WEF https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Economic_Forum released a report showing that gender equality has still not been reached in many countries, including western ones. The US ranked 53rd, below Zimbabwe. https://abcnews.go.com/Business/us-ranked-lower-zimbabwe-gender-equality-year-low/story?id=67775137  The UK ranked 21st and Australia ranked 44 globally.According to many reports it will take between 100 and 257 years to reach global gender equality.The WEF ranks equality based on health, education, economy and politics.One of the reasons that the US ranks so badly is maternal mortality rates and lack of any kind of maternity/paternity leave. Meaning any woman who gives birth in the US will suffer severe economic consequences.We all know that feminism is need globally but we must not let people tell us that it isn’t needed in the west because equality has already been reached.Remember the Equal Rights Amendment has never been ratified unto the constitution.

"Individual accounts, though often anecdotal, help comprise a working pattern of how men are treated. Any true story is worth hearing and understanding in order to protect one's person. I believe dumping is equally valid, because where else do men truly get to vent? I have yet to find a real world place to talk openly about  issues men face? Why? Many people either don't believe, don't care, or also hate men.Feminism has huge leverage, and one can readily find phrases such as ""kill all men"" or other legitimate hate speech aimed at destroying men. If ever this place became a dumping ground against women, their actions, and the legal/social bias against men, I would still support it. We can collectively share, learn, expose those who actively try to harm, and hopefully grow stronger. To have that sort of bond requires real stories from people's lives, as I know of nobody who develops a bond over statistics.Should it be complaining without a goal? No. Complain, find help, draw strength, continue on and keep trying to fix what can be fixed. Sometimes, things also aren't fixable due to how rigged society is (mental health being severely gate-kept from men in my experience), and we can still seek social help, educate, etc.Social forums or situations aren't static;they ebb and flow. This sub will, too. But, let men complain, let them vent, and let them ease their anger in a better setting than they otherwise have."	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--6090486b57f27442319d2dcb	00016b18b2--6090486b57f27442319d2dcb	APPROVED

To be fair, and I hate to be, to the participants in these posts. They are partially right. The problem is that word 'partially.'Women are at a disadvantage when it comes to physical aggression.  It doesn’t mean they can't or won't do it, but simply due to the fact that men are larger and have more upper body muscle mass, it makes such cases different. For instance, there is an increasing body of work that show women are at least as likely to physically abuse men, but men are far more likely to inflict severe physical injury when abusing women.Women also tend to be specialists at forms of abuse that, while there are men that do such, as a whole you will find men are simply not as 'gifted' there. I am specifically referring to verbal and mental abuse. In essence the sexes, while both engaging in the area the other specializes in, tend to move to specific types of abuse based on general predilections that are true generally if not for every case.Minimizing the damaging effects of either type of abuse is both dangerous and irresponsible.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609048efd207773d9012bcb0	00016b18b2--609048efd207773d9012bcb0	APPROVED

This kind of cognitive dissonance is always going to exist unfortunately. Though it's an interesting point you make about Latin America, lots of that news seems to have been really poorly spread, I hadn't heard of this at all and nobody I speak to had either. Meanwhile we all know about the toxic extremes of so-called feminism that's always going on. This is part of the problem, it used to be that people's reactions would pass this kind of news along, but now it seems media outlets are leading with these stories for more profit and interest while the actual important stuff goes a little more unnoticed.You'll find that people and platforms who identify as Egalitarian rather than Feminist are much better and give more shits about real issues.

Article:President Joe Biden has only been in office for less than a day, but he’s already busy undoing some of his predecessor’s legacy by firing some very awful people and issuing a spree of executive orders. We truly love to see it! In a sign that Biden is doing something right, one of the executive orders he issued on Wednesday night has pissed off a cohort of some of the worst people in the world—TERFs and other supposed feminists who have made it their mission in life in recent years to loudly fight the expansion of trans rights. Meant to tackle “discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation,” Biden’s executive order essentially calls on federal agencies to broadly apply last year’s landmark Bostock ruling, which expanded the definition of sex discrimination to include discrimination based on sexual orientation as well as gender identity. Notably, the executive order included the line, “Children should be able to learn without worrying about whether they will be denied access to the restroom, the locker room, or school sports,” and stated that Bostock should also apply to Title IX, the federal law that prohibits discrimination in federally funded schools.This has major implications for trans students, and signals an extremely welcome shift after the Trump administration, which marshaled the considerable resources of the federal government to make the lives of trans people as mean and limited as it possibly could. “It is such a relief to have a government that is committed to preventing discrimination as opposed to enabling it,” wrote the ACLU’s James Esseks, the director of the group’s LGBT & HIV Project, in a statement in response to the executive order. As the National Women’s Law Center’s Gillian Branstetter told Jezebel via email, Biden’s executive order “is a critical recognition of both last summer’s [Bostock] Supreme Court victory and the right of every person to learn, labor, and live without fear of prejudice or bias.”BIDEN, THEY CROAKED, IS “ERASING WOMEN.”But the move hit differently for all those who have spent recent years cloaking their transphobia in a shallow concern for women and girls. Biden, they croaked, is “erasing women.”The Women’s Liberation Front, or WoLF, a small group of so-called “radical feminists” who have partnered with the religious right to campaign against trans rights, wrote that Biden’s executive order “is a disaster for women and girls in the U.S.” and an “unprecedented attack on women’s rights and civil liberties.” Abigail Shrier, the writer whose book title—Irreversible Damage: The Transgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters—tells you all you need to know about her, jumped in with her own hyperbolic take, which was retweeted widely. “A new glass ceiling was just placed over girls,” warned Shrier darkly, adding that the executive order “unilaterally eviscerates women’s sports.” Even the Brits decided to weigh in; in a since-deleted tweet, the writer Hadley Freeman bemoaned that Biden’s move was “terrible,” adding later that it “will kill women’s sport.”That this fretting is actually anti-trans fearmongering hidden under the guise of a warped and outdated notion of feminism should be apparent. But the handwringing does, in its own way, acknowledge the potential repercussions that Biden’s executive order represents. As many have noted, it may give the many Republican legislators who are pushing bills targeting trans high school athletes a bit of pause, given that Biden’s executive order signals that the Department of Education may move to revoke federal funds from states that pass discriminatory laws against trans students. As the ACLU’s Chase Strangio put it, commenting on Montana’s bill being debated on Thursday that would bar trans girls from athletics, “The legislature is playing games with the state’s education system to attack trans young people.” He added, “Right now lawmakers are not only voting on trans lives but threatening the state’s federal funding.” Financial consequences, after all, seem to be the only ones that bigoted state lawmakers ever care about.	1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609062260f8c7004619699e3	00016b18b2--609062260f8c7004619699e3	APPROVED

My brother just got back from uni recently, I haven’t seen him in 7 months because of covid (and I’m pretty thankful for it. While we were having dinner tonight he said something about how teenage girls are always bitchy and insecure, I noted that that’s only how they’re painted as cause everything they like is seen as either basic or fake. My tone and pitch were constant and I was saying it lightheartedly and yet he still started acting like I was screaming at him for it. He made a motion to ‘calm me down’ with his hands and even exclaimed ‘Jesus Christ’ as if I’d been yelling. He does this every time I express an opinion, even if it doesn’t mean anything. During the same meal he did this when I answered that the reason there were so many flies was because we were eating outside.Even when we were younger he would tell me to butt out of discussions because ‘it didn’t involve me’ even if it directly did. At that time I could never understand why, I’ve realised now it’s because he doesn’t take me or my opinions seriously. Everything I say he acts like is unreasonable or an overreaction. I’ve been constantly checking myself around him for our entire lives. I never even noticed until he left and I saw the difference. He may be my brother, but I have no respect for him because of the way he acts. I made this post because I wanted to ask if anybody had any similar experiences. Not being taken seriously is a very important and dismissive attitude that is often put aside in light of more serious sexist behaviours.	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609062260f8c7004619699e3	00016b18b2--609062260f8c7004619699e3	APPROVED

Meaning any woman who gives birth in the US will suffer severe economic consequences.We all know that feminism is need globally but we must not let people tell us that it isn’t needed in the west because equality has already been reached.Remember the Equal Rights Amendment has never been ratified unto the constitution.

It tends to sort itself out pretty quick, because if you go into a misandric community to object to their sexism, you `[removed]`That being said, I think when self-identified feminists come here asking about this group, we should always start by giving them the benefit of the doubt.  The ones who are here to troll and browbeat drop the mask within minutes anyway.  I've seen people leave this sub with a genuine understanding of what we're about and why we criticize feminism when everyone operates on good faith.

You can spend your time reporting and blocking people, but if you really care (and you do) and have any sort of energy and ressources, spend every angry emotion and inner rants against these sexist men, to sign petitions, write articles and thought pieces, give suggestions to magazines on current women's issues. Take part in real life feminism, or volunteer for online activism; become a prominent person on a woman's rights website. Know that while these men spew anger on subreddits, you will shift the prominence of real life women and their rights. You are strengthening movements, while they are (ineffectively) strengthening their own reactionary mindsets; not even 20 men of these types, will get anything done, compared to just one moderately activist woman.Fight for women - and fight for yourself. Take care of yourself, also. With meditations, warm baths, hot tea, poetry, whatever; just make sure you do so.

I'm not gonna judge you for it and I definitely think that a big part of feminism is letting women use their bodies as they please because they own it, though I do think selling pictures of your body or selling your own body just contributes to the idea that women are an object and that consent has a price. I totally understand tho, that some women do it to survive and that it is a way to get extra money and sometimes you can't think of the negative effects it has on society cause you just need the money, so thinking about it deeply and technically I'd say that you can do what you want with your body thanks to feminism, but using it for money is not contributing to actual feminism, tho no one should judge you for it	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--6090629103acb656d0344a22	00016b18b2--6090629103acb656d0344a22	APPROVED

They're also a paleontologist, so there's legit research in a lot of their work.Can't speak for their published academic work because I haven't read it, but their fiction is incredible and a lot of their short stories are available online or in cheaper pulp collections at bookstores.

You can spend your time reporting and blocking people, but if you really care (and you do) and have any sort of energy and ressources, spend every angry emotion and inner rants against these sexist men, to sign petitions, write articles and thought pieces, give suggestions to magazines on current women's issues. Take part in real life feminism, or volunteer for online activism; become a prominent person on a woman's rights website. Know that while these men spew anger on subreddits, you will shift the prominence of real life women and their rights. You are strengthening movements, while they are (ineffectively) strengthening their own reactionary mindsets; not even 20 men of these types, will get anything done, compared to just one moderately activist woman.Fight for women - and fight for yourself. Take care of yourself, also. With meditations, warm baths, hot tea, poetry, whatever; just make sure you do so. Reading about oppression every day, and seeing examples of it constantly, would destroy anyone.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609064f0d2eb476f06310ebd	00016b18b2--609064f0d2eb476f06310ebd	APPROVED

I'm not gonna judge you for it and I definitely think that a big part of feminism is letting women use their bodies as they please because they own it, though I do think selling pictures of your body or selling your own body just contributes to the idea that women are an object and that consent has a price. I totally understand tho, that some women do it to survive and that it is a way to get extra money and sometimes you can't think of the negative effects it has on society cause you just need the money, so thinking about it deeply and technically I'd say that you can do what you want with your body thanks to feminism, but using it for money is not contributing to actual feminism, tho no one should judge you for it	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609064f0d2eb476f06310ebd	00016b18b2--609064f0d2eb476f06310ebd	APPROVED

I was valedictorian in elementary, middle, and was on the path until junior year of high school. I went through some trauma during that year and now while I do well in jobs, I always torpedo it and self sabotage by randomly quitting. It is a pattern that for some reason I cannot control.

"What if, for example, the pay gap is not erased through achieving egalitarian legislation and social reforms (gender neutral children's toys, etc.)? What if the choices males and females choose, free from any gender influencing, etc. leads to more males still in higher risk jobs, working longer hours, and/or being in higher paid jobs than females? Do you believe the only measure of true ""equity and equality"" is the outcome or the attempt to reach true parity? BTW, this is in no means a question meant to say we shouldn't be attempting to reach true equity/equality between the genders, I am honestly curious to what defines ""success"" and to what lengths one believes society should go to achieve them (ie strip away free employment choice? Gender quotas for every job?

I was talking to a girl whose cleavage was a bit exposed (and I am NOT criticizing her or her right to dress like this) and as we were speaking, my eyes sort of drifted down to the area between her neck and her breasts, for maybe a bit longer then they should have.As we were taking, she covered her shirt up a little, then my eyes immediately moved back up to her eyes and stayed there. She didn’t explicitly say anything (of course, this could’ve been because it wouldn’t have been worth her trouble), we continued to talk afterwards, and she didn’t appear hostile, but I couldn’t help but feel that I might’ve made her uncomfortable. I genuinely feel terrible and contrite about what I did.I initially considered what I did to be a disrespectful and embarrassing faux pas, and something from which I should learn to refrain from such behavior in the future. Yet for whatever reason I began to dwell uncontrollably on what I did, and with each instance of contemplation my perception of my action worsened.I should preface by explaining that in the past I've had tics that compel me to do things I otherwise shouldn't do. One such example consists of looking at my feet a total of four glances while I'm driving, precisely because I know I'm not supposed to. Similarly, when swimming underwater, I feel compelled often to open my mouth and let water in four times, as I know that it would be best not to do so. These tics may seem trivial, but they have been natural for me for a long time.Such tics have been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. I say this not to convey that these tics have made my life unbearable—they have not; rather, my purpose is to explain that these tics have become normalized for me. I’ve always suspected there may be an attention deficit component to these tics.When I was young, I developed a similar tic-like habit whereby I would look at private parts. This eventually developed into something where I knew I wasn’t supposed to do something, but precisely because of this I felt compelled to do it anyway. I don't know why this tic in general developed. Was it due to the frequent thoughts about sex I had when I was 6/7? Was it due to innocuous portrayals of such behavior in movies/TV? I’d feel the need to steal glances at a private area a total of four times, in general. This urge has been there not just with women’s décolletage, but also with mens’ crotches at times, or women’s legs. This is especially true when I’m engaged in conversation with someone. This urge-driven tic wouldn’t necessarily always be there in every single interaction, but through some interactions it would be there.It’s not that I deliberately try to leer or to make people uncomfortable. I don't openly stare, for instance, at a woman's chest for 10 seconds with wide eyes while drooling. I've never made comments, or touched, or tried to take up someone's personal space. I’m not trying to prey on people, or to try to impose myself on them sexually. For whatever reason, it's like when talking to a woman for extended time, it's hard for me to keep still in general. My eyes wander haphazardly, and combined with this tic, this happens.And yet my reasons should not matter as much as the effects of what I did to her. She covered her shirt, and odds are good I made her feel uncomfortable. In the moment, I ascribed what happened here to my tic, and judged that I had been rude and disrespectful at worst, and that if I learned from this, I could move on. But over time, my dwelling in this became far worse. She'd continued talking to me during that conversation, and she wasn't hostile, true. But what was she not showing me? How can I be sure exactly how bad I made her feel? Maybe I ruined her day. Maybe I ruined her whole week. Maybe I made her feel less of herself. Maybe I've affected her life immutably. Are these exaggerations? Am I obsessing over this to an unreasonable degree, or are these possible, reasonable ramifications of what I did?Furthermore, I began to fear that maybe, whilst I'd believed that I was never openly leering/ogling at people, what if I'd been wrong ever since I'd developed this tic? How many countless women could I have potentially made uncomfortable? No one has ever prior indicated that my presence made them uncomfortable. I've never been reported for anything even remotely minor. And yet I feel I can't be sure. I remember now just one other instance, from when I was younger, when a girl at school covered her shirt while I was talking to her. This is the only other time covering shirt had occurred. Was this due to my tic too?As I read stories of people like Morgan Freeman, Bill O'Rielly and their workplace sexual transgressions, I see small, maybe if only tangential, similarities between what they did and what I did. Men like this have commented in women's figures in the workplace, touched their skirts, asked them how they 'feel about sexual harassment.' These transgressions seem to me patently wrong and inexcusable. And yet another thing they've been accused of is leering women up and down. Coupled with their other systematic patterns of behavior, it seems as though this leering should be construed as further attempts to make women uncomfortable in the workplace. And although I've never been party to these other types of behavior, I can't help but feel peripherally associate with these men.Ultimately, I cannot ascertain for certain to what extent my actions in this instance stemmed from normalized tics, and to what extent it arose from subconscious irreverence for her person. I have little doubt that what I did stamp largely from a dependence on my normalized tics. Yet if I submitted to this tic, is this not the same as being irreverent to her person? Maybe I am no better than a Morgan Freeman/Bill O'Rielly.I've been hoping that the fact that she may not have even noticed, or likely forgot about what happened soon thereafter, may mean that I should get to move on if I promise to do better. But why not take this logic to completion? If a man rapes a woman, and she was too drunk or incapacitated to remember it, does this make him any less of a rapist? By the same logic, would her forgetting this make me any less of a harasser? Of a predator? I understand that to conflate rape with looking at cleavage would be disingenuous at best and malicious at worst—that's not my purpose. My purpose is to test this line of logic.I cannot live with myself thinking of myself as a sexual harasser. This label has been weighing on me for months at this point. I can't eat properly, and can't get assignments done, I'm hardly sleeping. Sound funny, or facetious? I'm being genuine. I am deeply sorry for what I did, and I understand now not only that what I did was wrong, but also why it was wrong. I am cognizant now of how differently women can perceive objectification, and that, even if my tics become difficult to resist, this is no excuse at all for disrespecting someone else's person. But I can't go on thinking of myself as a sexual harasser. I just can't.There are only two ways in which I could deviate from this course of action, either by rationalizing my actions or by and living with myself that way, or by accepting what I did, which would—even if only slightly peripherally—place me in a category of individuals with whom I am unequivocally unwilling to be associated. To commit to the former path would be to lead my life with unconscionable dishonesty; the latter, to undergo such a radical change in self-perception for which I have not the strength.There is no impartial mediator to help me guide my thoughts. I had one feminist friend who told me that I'm overreacting. Yet I'm confident that there would be other people who would say I'm not overreacting. But if one person thinks I'm a sexual harasser, there must be legitimacy to that, yes? If I'm even .5% associated with a group of people including Freeman, O'Rielly, Ansari, etc. I can't live right myself.I have virtually no concern with being potentially reported for sexual harassment. This isn't about that. It's about how I see myself. Judge me as you wish.	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--6090658b57f27442319f7d6b	00016b18b2--6090658b57f27442319f7d6b	APPROVED

Had some fights in middle school, dealt with some bullies. I was on the shorter side so some girls in my school thought they could fight me based on that. Some fights I lost in the beginning but after a while I learned from them so less wanted to fight me. High school, I had one girl try to kick me but she ended up regretting making that move since I kept twisting her leg. So I really only fight someone if someone is trying to cause harm or I see a little defenseless kid.

I immediately thought of the author Caitlin KiernanThey're a genderfluid (the novel I have identifies them as female transgender but I think that's outdated) atheist pagan.

They're also a paleontologist, so there's legit research in a lot of their work.Can't speak for their published academic work because I haven't read it, but their fiction is incredible and a lot of their short stories are available online or in cheaper pulp collections at bookstores.

"The thing with crimes is that we never know how many were committed. It's called the ""black number"" it refers to all the crimes committed that were not reported to the police.Sexual assault is considered to be the crime with the highest black number because it's so taboo. Since metoo we saw a rise in the amount of registered sexual assault, not because men were commiting more but because it was less taboo (for women) to report. Now we have a different problem, since society sees sexual assault as a women only issue, men are not taken seriously when they report that they themselves were victims, some men get raped but don't report because they got brainwashed into thinking that men can't be raped. People use this to say ""see, they're so many more female victims of sexual assault, so the problem is men"". The reality is more complicated, it is reasonable to think that more women gets sexually assaulted but it could be a proportion of 80/20 or even 60/40, we won't know until more studies goes out. But obviously, studies about male victims of sexual assault don't get a lot of funding.Also, I'm talking here about official criminal statistics, a lot of feminists ""research"" use self-revealed surveys, that often blur the line between sexual harassment and sexual assault. They also tend to give those surveys to populations that are more exposed to those behaviors (young college women, for example) and they generalize to whole study saying that ""it's about ALL women"".Anyways, feminists and society at large would benefit from a class of criminology."	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609068099fe36f17d7cbd7fe	00016b18b2--609068099fe36f17d7cbd7fe	APPROVED

I was grateful she did, because the doctor asked a *buttload* of questions I would not have known the answer to. She mentioned a long struggle with infertility before having me at 33, needing to be on bedrest at the end of that pregnancy, and my getting stuck and needing to be a C-section.

Maybe your girlfriend could try to talk in a relatively neutral way to the other (non crazy) friends? It's likely that they are just as annoyed but don't dare to speak up.Maybe this could set things moving, that together they tell her they don't like her misandry.Often, people just are too afraid to say something because they are unsure if they are the only one who sees the problem.

Society can't protect people from all harm: it's impossible. The best that can be achieved is risk reduction and this is accomplished by society and the individual: both have responsibilities over the outcome. For example, the local Council is usually responsible for ensuring paths do not have significant tripping hazards, but it is the individuals responsibility to ensure they do not contribute to the risk themselves with loose shoelaces or not looking where they are walking.The world is a dangerous place: you might believe you are entitled not to be harmed in any way, but that is a false expectation. So what do we do with the fear that everything out there is potentially going to harm us?The reality is that actual harm is naturally mediated by circumstance including motive, means and opportunity. If we look at statistics of harm, any individual generally has a very low risk of experiencing serious harm and although the risk increases for less serious harm, it is still usually quite low and also the impact of that harm is less.Based on the low probability of harm and the very low probability of serious harm, our fears should be much lower than believing everything out there is going to harm us and maybe low enough that living our lives, even in the presence of some harm, is a risk we are willing to take versus the certainty of harm in not living our lives if we isolate ourselves from the world outside. However, it requires rational moderation of our own emotional impulses for our fears to be put into perspective and proportion and unfortunately, for whatever reason, some elements in our community are stoking emotional impulses instead of rational moderation.Society and the individual can further reduce risk by ameliorating the circumstantial factors of motive, means and opportunity. Deliberately making ourselves helpless to defend ourselves by becoming intoxicated, for example, increases opportunity for harm.Deterrents can act as a motive modifier, but only in circumstances where rational moderation of emotional impulses is engaged: they are relatively ineffectual if an action potentially resulting in harm stems from a strong emotional impulse or impulse moderation is compromised. That's why crimes of passion tend to ignore punitive laws: angry people ignoring Apprehended Violence Orders for example. In terms of outcome, relying on deterrents to minimise all crimes is counterproductive as it generates a false sense of security: punishing harm is little comfort, after the fact, when the harm has already occurred. Far better to aim for prevention as much as that is possible. Unfortunately our system is setup almost entirely based on deterrence through punishment.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609069cb6d35fb117b90cafd	00016b18b2--609069cb6d35fb117b90cafd	APPROVED

"What do you say to the people who argue that making this decision for a child that can't consent isn't an issue because it is morally equivalent to something like religious indoctrination (or upbringing for a more neutral term), or that this logic at least leads down the road of suddenly looking at parents making decisions for their children in general as child abuse.When my step dad's brother argued this, I felt kind of out of my element. He is a doctor himself and could also speak from a place of experience (although European, so uncommon but still legal). What's your opinion on this being like ""forcing"" a worldview upon your child?

I immediately thought of the author Caitlin KiernanThey're a genderfluid (the novel I have identifies them as female transgender but I think that's outdated) atheist pagan.

They're also a paleontologist, so there's legit research in a lot of their work.Can't speak for their published academic work because I haven't read it, but their fiction is incredible and a lot of their short stories are available online or in cheaper pulp collections at bookstores.

“Again” implies that something big happened to steal selfness.

Happily, i have a lot of respect for people who put in the time, effort, and work it takes to learn a craft like that. Whether im willing to date or marry some has more to do with who they are than what they do, but from a more objective or analytical perspective, marrying a blue-collar worker almost guarantees security.

Remember the #believeHer slogan? That if a woman says she was raped you have to believe her?I have a better one. **#DontBeliveHer!** It is innocent until proven guilty! No man deserves to lose his reputation over a false accusation. And it boils my blood that when women are caught lying about rape, they are not punished, their reputation not destroyed. They don't get raped or beaten up in prison. And they get to continue their life like it was nothing.Fuck this shit. If I'm ever accused by someone and law fails to give them the exact same punishment they would give me, I will take matters in my own hands.**#DONTBELIVEHER** There has been too many lives destroyed by the law allowing women to take revenge on innocent men.

"I was raised in a church like that too, and I remember one woman who decided to leave in favor of witchcraft. The church painted her like she was demon-possessed.

Agreed! Involving children in an abrahamic religion at a young age is messed up because it teaches them that they’re sinning trash and they need to run a hamster wheel their entire life to get gods approval.

Had some fights in middle school, dealt with some bullies. I was on the shorter side so some girls in my school thought they could fight me based on that. Some fights I lost in the beginning but after a while I learned from them so less wanted to fight me. High school, I had one girl try to kick me but she ended up regretting making that move since I kept twisting her leg. So I really only fight someone if someone is trying to cause harm or I see a little defenseless kid. It's like a very last resort to use.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--60906e73bb4ccb009f9ad749	00016b18b2--60906e73bb4ccb009f9ad749	APPROVED

Maybe your girlfriend could try to talk in a relatively neutral way to the other (non crazy) friends? It's likely that they are just as annoyed but don't dare to speak up.Maybe this could set things moving, that together they tell her they don't like her misandry.Often, people just are too afraid to say something because they are unsure if they are the only one who sees the problem.

Society can't protect people from all harm: it's impossible. The best that can be achieved is risk reduction and this is accomplished by society and the individual: both have responsibilities over the outcome. For example, the local Council is usually responsible for ensuring paths do not have significant tripping hazards, but it is the individuals responsibility to ensure they do not contribute to the risk themselves with loose shoelaces or not looking where they are walking.The world is a dangerous place: you might believe you are entitled not to be harmed in any way, but that is a false expectation. So what do we do with the fear that everything out there is potentially going to harm us?The reality is that actual harm is naturally mediated by circumstance including motive, means and opportunity. If we look at statistics of harm, any individual generally has a very low risk of experiencing serious harm and although the risk increases for less serious harm, it is still usually quite low and also the impact of that harm is less.Based on the low probability of harm and the very low probability of serious harm, our fears should be much lower than believing everything out there is going to harm us and maybe low enough that living our lives, even in the presence of some harm, is a risk we are willing to take versus the certainty of harm in not living our lives if we isolate ourselves from the world outside. However, it requires rational moderation of our own emotional impulses for our fears to be put into perspective and proportion and unfortunately, for whatever reason, some elements in our community are stoking emotional impulses instead of rational moderation.Society and the individual can further reduce risk by ameliorating the circumstantial factors of motive, means and opportunity. Deliberately making ourselves helpless to defend ourselves by becoming intoxicated, for example, increases opportunity for harm.Deterrents can act as a motive modifier, but only in circumstances where rational moderation of emotional impulses is engaged: they are relatively ineffectual if an action potentially resulting in harm stems from a strong emotional impulse or impulse moderation is compromised. That's why crimes of passion tend to ignore punitive laws: angry people ignoring Apprehended Violence Orders for example. In terms of outcome, relying on deterrents to minimise all crimes is counterproductive as it generates a false sense of security: punishing harm is little comfort, after the fact, when the harm has already occurred. Far better to aim for prevention as much as that is possible. Unfortunately our system is setup almost entirely based on deterrence through punishment.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--60906eee03acb656d034ca91	00016b18b2--60906eee03acb656d034ca91	APPROVED

"What do you say to the people who argue that making this decision for a child that can't consent isn't an issue because it is morally equivalent to something like religious indoctrination (or upbringing for a more neutral term), or that this logic at least leads down the road of suddenly looking at parents making decisions for their children in general as child abuse.When my step dad's brother argued this, I felt kind of out of my element. He is a doctor himself and could also speak from a place of experience (although European, so uncommon but still legal). What's your opinion on this being like ""forcing"" a worldview upon your child?

"The thing with crimes is that we never know how many were committed. It's called the ""black number"" it refers to all the crimes committed that were not reported to the police.Sexual assault is considered to be the crime with the highest black number because it's so taboo. Since metoo we saw a rise in the amount of registered sexual assault, not because men were commiting more but because it was less taboo (for women) to report. Now we have a different problem, since society sees sexual assault as a women only issue, men are not taken seriously when they report that they themselves were victims, some men get raped but don't report because they got brainwashed into thinking that men can't be raped. People use this to say ""see, they're so many more female victims of sexual assault, so the problem is men"". The reality is more complicated, it is reasonable to think that more women gets sexually assaulted but it could be a proportion of 80/20 or even 60/40, we won't know until more studies goes out. But obviously, studies about male victims of sexual assault don't get a lot of funding.Also, I'm talking here about official criminal statistics, a lot of feminists ""research"" use self-revealed surveys, that often blur the line between sexual harassment and sexual assault. They also tend to give those surveys to populations that are more exposed to those behaviors (young college women, for example) and they generalize to whole study saying that ""it's about ALL women"".Anyways, feminists and society at large would benefit from a class of criminology."	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--6090736c3831085841422b4b	00016b18b2--6090736c3831085841422b4b	APPROVED

I can think of *many* times this has happened to me in the last 9 years. My reactions have ranged from1. Pushing his hand away from my face and telling him to go home (he was so drunk he couldn't walk straight).2. Closing the door in his face, as he continued to beg (because he was married and I  desperately needed a shit).3. Letting him in, chatting for 10 minutes, then telling him to go home (like I told him before he had entered the building).4. Letting him in, having sex, then telling him to go home (because I wanted the bed to myself).There have been more cases than that. But you know what? On *no* occasion has my telling him to go home resulted in the date never talking to me again. Quite the opposite. So if you do like the guy, you *do not need to feel bad* about asking him to go home. And as for the 'needing the loo' excuse? Guys pee in public *all the time*. Guarantee he will be fine without access to your toilet.	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--6090738040338e07319d5bba	00016b18b2--6090738040338e07319d5bba	APPROVED

"let me just copy and paste real quickedit: So what you're saying is that you, a commenter using a username on an internet forum are the true feminist, and the feminists actually responsible for changing the laws, writing the academic theory, teaching the courses, influencing the public policies, and the massive, well-funded feminist organizations with thousands and thousands of members all of whom call themselves feminists... they are not ""real feminists""? You're not the director of the Feminist Majority Foundation and editor of Ms. Magazine, Katherine Spillar, who said of domestic violence: ""Well, that's just a clean-up word for wife-beating,"" and went on to add that regarding male victims of dating violence, ""we know it's not girls beating up boys, it's boys beating up girls.""You're not Jan Reimer, former mayor of Edmonton and long-time head of Alberta's Network of Women's Shelters, who just a few years ago refused to appear on a TV program discussing male victims of domestic violence, because for her to even show up and discuss it would lend legitimacy to the idea that they exist.You're not Mary P Koss, who describes male victims of female rapists in her academic papers as being not rape victims because they were ""ambivalent about their sexual desires"" (if you don't know what that means, it's that they actually wanted it), and then went on to define them out of the definition of rape in the CDC's research because it's inappropriate to consider what happened to them rape.You're not the National Organization for Women, and its associated legal foundations, who lobbied to replace the gender neutral federal Family Violence Prevention and Services Act of 1984 with the obscenely gendered Violence Against Women Act of 1994. The passing of that law cut male victims out of support services and legal assistance in more than 60 passages, just because they were male.You're not the Florida chapter of the NOW, who successfully lobbied to have Governor Rick Scott veto not one, but two alimony reform bills in the last ten years, bills that had passed both houses with overwhelming bipartisan support, and were supported by more than 70% of the electorate.You're not the feminist group in Maryland who convinced every female member of the House on both sides of the aisle to walk off the floor when a shared parenting bill came up for a vote, meaning the quorum could not be met and the bill died then and there.You're not the feminists in Canada agitating to remove sexual assault from the normal criminal courts, into quasi-criminal courts of equity where the burden of proof would be lowered, the defendant could be compelled to testify, discovery would go both ways, and defendants would not be entitled to a public defender.You're not Professor Elizabeth Sheehy, who wrote a book advocating that women not only have the right to murder their husbands without fear of prosecution if they make a claim of abuse, but that they have the moral responsibility to murder their husbands.You're not the feminist legal scholars and advocates who successfully changed rape laws such that a woman's history of making multiple false allegations of rape can be excluded from evidence at trial because it's ""part of her sexual history.""You're not the feminists who splattered the media with the false claim that putting your penis in a passed-out woman's mouth is ""not a crime"" in Oklahoma, because the prosecutor was incompetent and charged the defendant under an inappropriate statute (forcible sodomy) and the higher court refused to expand the definition of that statute beyond its intended scope when there was already a perfectly good one (sexual battery) already there. You're not the idiot feminists lying to the public and potentially putting women in Oklahoma at risk by telling potential offenders there's a ""legal"" way to rape them.And you're none of the hundreds or thousands of feminist scholars, writers, thinkers, researchers, teachers and philosophers who constructed and propagate the body of bunkum theories upon which all of these atrocities are based.No...You're the true feminist.

Ive never found any reasearch on this, but when I was at uni, men were exhausted from working long hours and attending classes, while women tended to perform due to their ability to concentrate on their studies.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609073f03831085841422ebb	00016b18b2--609073f03831085841422ebb	APPROVED

It depends how the information was given. Did he blurt it out without any precursor during a date? Did he say this while expecting accolades or something in return for his statement? Did he say it looking for a reaction? What is he looking for in saying this? To me the context matters. I've had bad experiences that made me want to squirm out of my skin and solid conversations depending on context. Men who expect something and try to tell you what they think you want to hear are incredibly sketchy. They want something and that something isn't a conversation. Men who want to bounce ideas and thoughts off of, I'm more than happy to talk to them.

"Karen Straughan's response to ""those aren't real feminists""*The following is a very informed and highly reusable  comment by Karen Straughan in response to a feminist who thinks the many blatant sexists among feminists aren't real feminists:* So what you're saying is that you, a commenter using a username on an internet forum are the true feminist, and the feminists actually responsible for changing the laws, writing the academic theory, teaching the courses, influencing the public policies, and the massive, well-funded feminist organizations with thousands and thousands of members all of whom call themselves feminists... they are not ""real feminists"".That's not just ""no true Scotsman"". That's delusional self deception.Listen, if you want to call yourself a feminist, I don't care. I've been investigating feminism for more than 9 years now, and people like you used to piss me off, because to my mind all you were doing was providing cover and ballast for the powerful political and academic feminists you claim are just jerks. And believe me, they ARE jerks. If you knew half of what I know about the things they've done under the banner of feminism, maybe you'd stop calling yourself one.But I want you to know. You don't matter. You're not the director of the Feminist Majority Foundation and editor of Ms. Magazine, Katherine Spillar, who said of domestic violence: ""Well, that's just a clean-up word for wife-beating,"" and went on to add that regarding male victims of dating violence, ""we know it's not girls beating up boys, it's boys beating up girls.""You're not Jan Reimer, former mayor of Edmonton and long-time head of Alberta's Network of Women's Shelters, who just a few years ago refused to appear on a TV program discussing male victims of domestic violence, because for her to even show up and discuss it would lend legitimacy to the idea that they exist.You're not Mary P Koss, who describes male victims of female rapists in her academic papers as being not rape victims because they were ""ambivalent about their sexual desires"" (if you don't know what that means, it's that they actually wanted it), and then went on to define them out of the definition of rape in the CDC's research because it's inappropriate to consider what happened to them rape.You're not the National Organization for Women, and its associated legal foundations, who lobbied to replace the gender neutral federal Family Violence Prevention and Services Act of 1984 with the obscenely gendered Violence Against Women Act of 1994. The passing of that law cut male victims out of support services and legal assistance in more than 60 passages, just because they were male.You're not the Florida chapter of the NOW, who successfully lobbied to have Governor Rick Scott veto not one, but two alimony reform bills in the last ten years, bills that had passed both houses with overwhelming bipartisan support, and were supported by more than 70% of the electorate.You're not the feminist group in Maryland who convinced every female member of the House on both sides of the aisle to walk off the floor when a shared parenting bill came up for a vote, meaning the quorum could not be met and the bill died then and there.You're not the feminists in Canada agitating to remove sexual assault from the normal criminal courts, into quasi-criminal courts of equity where the burden of proof would be lowered, the defendant could be compelled to testify, discovery would go both ways, and defendants would not be entitled to a public defender.You're not Professor Elizabeth Sheehy, who wrote a book advocating that women not only have the right to murder their husbands without fear of prosecution if they make a claim of abuse, but that they have the moral responsibility to murder their husbands.You're not the feminist legal scholars and advocates who successfully changed rape laws such that a woman's history of making multiple false allegations of rape can be excluded from evidence at trial because it's ""part of her sexual history.""You're not the feminists who splattered the media with the false claim that putting your penis in a passed-out woman's mouth is ""not a crime"" in Oklahoma, because the prosecutor was incompetent and charged the defendant under an inappropriate statute (forcible sodomy) and the higher court refused to expand the definition of that statute beyond its intended scope when there was already a perfectly good one (sexual battery) already there. You're not the idiot feminists lying to the public and potentially putting women in Oklahoma at risk by telling potential offenders there's a ""legal"" way to rape them.And you're none of the hundreds or thousands of feminist scholars, writers, thinkers, researchers, teachers and philosophers who constructed and propagate the body of bunkum theories upon which all of these atrocities are based.You're the true feminist. Some random person on the internet."	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--6090743f3831085841423256	00016b18b2--6090743f3831085841423256	APPROVED
You messed up badly.First off, C's behavior was inappropriate, whether it was consensual or not. To be frank with you, you have no idea what her relationship with everyone else is. For all you know, they may all be great friends, completely fine with her doing that. She never touched you so you weren't part of her circle of friends.With that said, touching other people like that at work, even if they consent, is **not acceptable workplace behavior.** Even if she only touched one person around the office like that, and that person happened to be her husband, she should be reprimanded for creating a hostile work environment for other people.But dude... come on. You actually touched her ass? What the hell were you thinking? This is beyond her being a feminist, a woman, or anything else. You jumped in on the little game they were playing without invitation and naturally she got pissed off at you. My wife is allowed to reach down my pants and play with my balls if she wants; this doesn't mean random women on the street are.I'm not surprised they didn't even want your 30 days notice. This isn't an MRM issue. This isn't a double standard.

**Gav Thorpe - The Sundering.**It's Warhammer Fantasy, but the point is the writing technique: the book is an omnibus edition of 3 other books, each telling the same story (and each progressing it a little further), but all 3 books use different point of views because the main character is different, who was maybe mentioned here and there in the first, is now the protagonist of the second and things like that.The story itself is about civil war and how both (maybe 3?) side loses.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609074480f15e875b153178f	00016b18b2--609074480f15e875b153178f	APPROVED

I'm going with a not very romantic option here but my SO and I are at a point in our life where marriage will make it easier to protect our finances and assets, especially in the worst cases like in illness or a death. Before we have kids, we want those protections in place. We want to be legally recognized as a married couple so that we take on those particular set of legal rights and obligations. Especially as I have a family that would happily screw him over if something happened to me.Of course it's taken us 10 years of a very happy and loving relationship to get to this point where we feel confident in embracing those legal rights.

I can think of *many* times this has happened to me in the last 9 years. My reactions have ranged from1. Pushing his hand away from my face and telling him to go home (he was so drunk he couldn't walk straight).2. Closing the door in his face, as he continued to beg (because he was married and I  desperately needed a shit).3. Letting him in, chatting for 10 minutes, then telling him to go home (like I told him before he had entered the building).4. Letting him in, having sex, then telling him to go home (because I wanted the bed to myself).There have been more cases than that. But you know what? On *no* occasion has my telling him to go home resulted in the date never talking to me again. Quite the opposite. So if you do like the guy, you *do not need to feel bad* about asking him to go home. And as for the 'needing the loo' excuse? Guys pee in public *all the time*. Guarantee he will be fine without access to your toilet.	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609074d970a1e819bcbab312	00016b18b2--609074d970a1e819bcbab312	APPROVED

Had some fights in middle school, dealt with some bullies. I was on the shorter side so some girls in my school thought they could fight me based on that. Some fights I lost in the beginning but after a while I learned from them so less wanted to fight me. High school, I had one girl try to kick me but she ended up regretting making that move since I kept twisting her leg.

"Well, you could start with [this article by scientific american](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/sexual-victimization-by-women-is-more-common-than-previously-known/) that says that ""men and women were equally likely to experience nonconsensual sex, and most male victims reported female perpetrators"". I am a man, and I have rarely been sexually harassed by men, despite being in the theater program, in which only one other man is straight. I have been sexually harassed and assaulted by a few different women, one of whom showed me porn, flashed me and about four other people her tit,  twerked on a guy that I know, tried to twerk on me, and grabbed my dick, all while having a boyfriend at the time.. None of this was with consent, and none of it was enjoyed, despite the stereotype that male victims aren't victims because they like it. Sexual aggression is not related to sexism, it's related to feelings of power, which women want just as much as men.&#x200B;To be clear, I am not anti-feminist. I just think that many feminists do not know the challenges that men face, and rape of men not being taken seriously is one of the worst things about being a man.  Male rape victims have been ridiculed, told to ""Man up"", and forced to pay child support while their rapist gets to keep the child. [Example 1](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/09/02/statutory-rape-victim-child-support/14953965/), [Example 2](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/talking-about-trauma/201902/when-male-rape-victims-are-accountable-child-support)&#x200B;I **do not** intend to downplay any struggles that women face, and I have heard stories of male rapists getting custody of the victims child. But injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere, and ignoring injustice against men will not stop injustice against women. I am not anti-feminist pro-masculist, or anti-masculist pro-feminist. Simply put, I am pro-justice."	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--6090758e70a1e819bcbabaea	00016b18b2--6090758e70a1e819bcbabaea	APPROVED

I can think of *many* times this has happened to me in the last 9 years. My reactions have ranged from1. Pushing his hand away from my face and telling him to go home (he was so drunk he couldn't walk straight).2. Closing the door in his face, as he continued to beg (because he was married and I  desperately needed a shit).3. Letting him in, chatting for 10 minutes, then telling him to go home (like I told him before he had entered the building).4. Letting him in, having sex, then telling him to go home (because I wanted the bed to myself).There have been more cases than that. But you know what? On *no* occasion has my telling him to go home resulted in the date never talking to me again. Quite the opposite. So if you do like the guy, you *do not need to feel bad* about asking him to go home. And as for the 'needing the loo' excuse? Guys pee in public *all the time*. Guarantee he will be fine without access to your toilet.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--6090759319d8d52be2e1b37d	00016b18b2--6090759319d8d52be2e1b37d	APPROVED

"Well, you could start with [this article by scientific american](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/sexual-victimization-by-women-is-more-common-than-previously-known/) that says that ""men and women were equally likely to experience nonconsensual sex, and most male victims reported female perpetrators"". I am a man, and I have rarely been sexually harassed by men, despite being in the theater program, in which only one other man is straight. I have been sexually harassed and assaulted by a few different women, one of whom showed me porn, flashed me and about four other people her tit,  twerked on a guy that I know, tried to twerk on me, and grabbed my dick, all while having a boyfriend at the time.. None of this was with consent, and none of it was enjoyed, despite the stereotype that male victims aren't victims because they like it. Sexual aggression is not related to sexism, it's related to feelings of power, which women want just as much as men.&#x200B;To be clear, I am not anti-feminist. I just think that many feminists do not know the challenges that men face, and rape of men not being taken seriously is one of the worst things about being a man.  Male rape victims have been ridiculed, told to ""Man up"", and forced to pay child support while their rapist gets to keep the child. [Example 1](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/09/02/statutory-rape-victim-child-support/14953965/), [Example 2](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/talking-about-trauma/201902/when-male-rape-victims-are-accountable-child-support)&#x200B;I **do not** intend to downplay any struggles that women face, and I have heard stories of male rapists getting custody of the victims child. But injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere, and ignoring injustice against men will not stop injustice against women. I am not anti-feminist pro-masculist, or anti-masculist pro-feminist. Simply put, I am pro-justice."	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609075d3aae37140692c572e	00016b18b2--609075d3aae37140692c572e	APPROVED

Not sure if it's necessity exactly, but my husband is from the EU and I'm American, and even though neither of us were totally wild on the concept of marriage (we literally eloped just the two of us last year because we aren't big on huge parties or celebrations for ourselves - love them for others though!), we knew down the line it'd be SO much easier to be and stay together being married than it would just being in a relationship. We've been together 6 years, married almost one, and are expecting our first child in November. We are super happy together and living in our third country/second continent together and the first time living in one of our home countries (his) together, and we love it. Sometimes it's just easier to take the plunge than to live with uncertainty over visas and legal issues that come from being a multi-culti couple.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609075e17a614251c96ffa27	00016b18b2--609075e17a614251c96ffa27	APPROVED

“Again” implies that something big happened to steal selfness.

Happily, i have a lot of respect for people who put in the time, effort, and work it takes to learn a craft like that. Whether im willing to date or marry some has more to do with who they are than what they do, but from a more objective or analytical perspective, marrying a blue-collar worker almost guarantees security.

Society can't protect people from all harm: it's impossible. The best that can be achieved is risk reduction and this is accomplished by society and the individual: both have responsibilities over the outcome. For example, the local Council is usually responsible for ensuring paths do not have significant tripping hazards, but it is the individuals responsibility to ensure they do not contribute to the risk themselves with loose shoelaces or not looking where they are walking.The world is a dangerous place: you might believe you are entitled not to be harmed in any way, but that is a false expectation. So what do we do with the fear that everything out there is potentially going to harm us?The reality is that actual harm is naturally mediated by circumstance including motive, means and opportunity. If we look at statistics of harm, any individual generally has a very low risk of experiencing serious harm and although the risk increases for less serious harm, it is still usually quite low and also the impact of that harm is less.Based on the low probability of harm and the very low probability of serious harm, our fears should be much lower than believing everything out there is going to harm us and maybe low enough that living our lives, even in the presence of some harm, is a risk we are willing to take versus the certainty of harm in not living our lives if we isolate ourselves from the world outside. However, it requires rational moderation of our own emotional impulses for our fears to be put into perspective and proportion and unfortunately, for whatever reason, some elements in our community are stoking emotional impulses instead of rational moderation.Society and the individual can further reduce risk by ameliorating the circumstantial factors of motive, means and opportunity. Deliberately making ourselves helpless to defend ourselves by becoming intoxicated, for example, increases opportunity for harm.Deterrents can act as a motive modifier, but only in circumstances where rational moderation of emotional impulses is engaged: they are relatively ineffectual if an action potentially resulting in harm stems from a strong emotional impulse or impulse moderation is compromised. That's why crimes of passion tend to ignore punitive laws: angry people ignoring Apprehended Violence Orders for example. In terms of outcome, relying on deterrents to minimise all crimes is counterproductive as it generates a false sense of security: punishing harm is little comfort, after the fact, when the harm has already occurred. Far better to aim for prevention as much as that is possible. Unfortunately our system is setup almost entirely based on deterrence through punishment.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--6090762ee70f0974b1895350	00016b18b2--6090762ee70f0974b1895350	APPROVED

"What do you say to the people who argue that making this decision for a child that can't consent isn't an issue because it is morally equivalent to something like religious indoctrination (or upbringing for a more neutral term), or that this logic at least leads down the road of suddenly looking at parents making decisions for their children in general as child abuse.When my step dad's brother argued this, I felt kind of out of my element. He is a doctor himself and could also speak from a place of experience (although European, so uncommon but still legal).

Not sure if it's necessity exactly, but my husband is from the EU and I'm American, and even though neither of us were totally wild on the concept of marriage (we literally eloped just the two of us last year because we aren't big on huge parties or celebrations for ourselves - love them for others though!), we knew down the line it'd be SO much easier to be and stay together being married than it would just being in a relationship. We've been together 6 years, married almost one, and are expecting our first child in November. We are super happy together and living in our third country/second continent together and the first time living in one of our home countries (his) together, and we love it. Sometimes it's just easier to take the plunge than to live with uncertainty over visas and legal issues that come from being a multi-culti couple.	1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609076490fcbf23df04c8d0a	00016b18b2--609076490fcbf23df04c8d0a	APPROVED

This might be a dramatic response but I get so angry about this. They’re making a product to sell on the basis that our beauty isn’t quite enough— that it could be “enhanced,” or “accentuated.” Marketing people and bloggers love those words. They think they’re not offensive, but they are offensive. And the truth is that my face IS the most beautiful, perfect, intriguing version of my face there is. And the beauty industry has the audacity to say, “we can make you more beautiful.” On what authority? With what power? Their chemicals synthesized in sterile little labs are no match for the cosmic stardust that made up my face. What arrogance and what conceit to believe they know my beauty better than I do. To believe they can manipulate my sense of self and my confidence to convince me my beauty, my presence, and my power would be improved if I purchased a product from them or elected to have a procedure. And all their efforts to manipulate and brainwash are for the sole purpose of fattening their own wallets.	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--60907677d95ac73c354d5a92	00016b18b2--60907677d95ac73c354d5a92	APPROVED

Yep. The number of times people have pointed to this or that porn star as proof that the industry can be empowering or ethical, and then a few years later that same woman comes out about the abuse she experienced and the trauma she's enduring as a result. Also... Why does it feel like we're just reliving the 20th century here? Remember Upton Sinclair, The Jungle, muckraking? Why does it feel like we're now going through the exact same thing, but for the digital ecosystem? And at the same time so many ostensible leftists are decrying any attempt at workplace regulation, which blows my mind.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--60907677d95ac73c354d5a92	00016b18b2--60907677d95ac73c354d5a92	APPROVED
"Hey there! Congratulations on your beautiful transition into your True Self. This is absolutely feminism related and it's eeeeeeverywhere.Women don't signal their skillset because they're gonna end up fucking doing the work anyway. Men talk. ""If you want it talked about, ask a man. If you want it done, ask a woman."" - Margaret Thatcher Things like vocal fry, ending sentences as questions?  and verbal qualifiers (""is it just me, or..."" and ""that's just my opinion"" and literally saying ""I don't know"") are all noted throughout feminism as women consciously and unconsciously playing into their role within a heteronormative patriarchal capitalist society. To observe and report as a female that ""doesn't know,"" is less qualified, silent + pretty, ""knows her place,"" and, most importantly is there solely for men's pleasure and servitude is to continue to reinforce that patriarchy, *whether she is aware of it or not.*The women who have had to fight to be heard as equals, especially in the workplace, have been doing so for decades.Unequal pay has zero to do with any ""modesty"" and everything to do with patriarchy. For the .77 cents a white woman makes, a woman of color makes .40-.65 of that same dollar. The pay is a statistical reflection of the perceived value of these individuals *regardless if their qualifications* within a capitalist patriarchy."	1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--60907677d95ac73c354d5a92	00016b18b2--60907677d95ac73c354d5a92	APPROVED

"let me just copy and paste real quickedit: So what you're saying is that you, a commenter using a username on an internet forum are the true feminist, and the feminists actually responsible for changing the laws, writing the academic theory, teaching the courses, influencing the public policies, and the massive, well-funded feminist organizations with thousands and thousands of members all of whom call themselves feminists... they are not ""real feminists""? You're not the director of the Feminist Majority Foundation and editor of Ms. Magazine, Katherine Spillar, who said of domestic violence: ""Well, that's just a clean-up word for wife-beating,"" and went on to add that regarding male victims of dating violence, ""we know it's not girls beating up boys, it's boys beating up girls.""You're not Jan Reimer, former mayor of Edmonton and long-time head of Alberta's Network of Women's Shelters, who just a few years ago refused to appear on a TV program discussing male victims of domestic violence, because for her to even show up and discuss it would lend legitimacy to the idea that they exist.You're not Mary P Koss, who describes male victims of female rapists in her academic papers as being not rape victims because they were ""ambivalent about their sexual desires"" (if you don't know what that means, it's that they actually wanted it), and then went on to define them out of the definition of rape in the CDC's research because it's inappropriate to consider what happened to them rape.You're not the National Organization for Women, and its associated legal foundations, who lobbied to replace the gender neutral federal Family Violence Prevention and Services Act of 1984 with the obscenely gendered Violence Against Women Act of 1994. The passing of that law cut male victims out of support services and legal assistance in more than 60 passages, just because they were male.You're not the Florida chapter of the NOW, who successfully lobbied to have Governor Rick Scott veto not one, but two alimony reform bills in the last ten years, bills that had passed both houses with overwhelming bipartisan support, and were supported by more than 70% of the electorate.You're not the feminist group in Maryland who convinced every female member of the House on both sides of the aisle to walk off the floor when a shared parenting bill came up for a vote, meaning the quorum could not be met and the bill died then and there.You're not the feminists in Canada agitating to remove sexual assault from the normal criminal courts, into quasi-criminal courts of equity where the burden of proof would be lowered, the defendant could be compelled to testify, discovery would go both ways, and defendants would not be entitled to a public defender.You're not Professor Elizabeth Sheehy, who wrote a book advocating that women not only have the right to murder their husbands without fear of prosecution if they make a claim of abuse, but that they have the moral responsibility to murder their husbands.You're not the feminist legal scholars and advocates who successfully changed rape laws such that a woman's history of making multiple false allegations of rape can be excluded from evidence at trial because it's ""part of her sexual history.""You're not the feminists who splattered the media with the false claim that putting your penis in a passed-out woman's mouth is ""not a crime"" in Oklahoma, because the prosecutor was incompetent and charged the defendant under an inappropriate statute (forcible sodomy) and the higher court refused to expand the definition of that statute beyond its intended scope when there was already a perfectly good one (sexual battery) already there. You're not the idiot feminists lying to the public and potentially putting women in Oklahoma at risk by telling potential offenders there's a ""legal"" way to rape them.And you're none of the hundreds or thousands of feminist scholars, writers, thinkers, researchers, teachers and philosophers who constructed and propagate the body of bunkum theories upon which all of these atrocities are based.No...You're the true feminist.

I'm going with a not very romantic option here but my SO and I are at a point in our life where marriage will make it easier to protect our finances and assets, especially in the worst cases like in illness or a death. Before we have kids, we want those protections in place. We want to be legally recognized as a married couple so that we take on those particular set of legal rights and obligations. Especially as I have a family that would happily screw him over if something happened to me.Of course it's taken us 10 years of a very happy and loving relationship to get to this point where we feel confident in embracing those legal rights.

I'm a celibate virgin who has thought of adoption, surrogacy, and artificial insemination as substitutes for traditional fatherhood. Adoption may be the easiest of the 3 because there's usually always an orphan or fatherless child in a society. I'm thinking of adoption though some societies might not want to give kids to men as much as give kids to women.Have you looked into the laws of surrogacy before considering it? Just as there are laws governing adoption and marriage, there may be laws governing surrogacy. Surrogacy also might mean your having sex with a woman, so you'd have to be mindful of sex laws and false rape accusations. Outside of that, surrogacy may be fine.

"Well, you could start with [this article by scientific american](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/sexual-victimization-by-women-is-more-common-than-previously-known/) that says that ""men and women were equally likely to experience nonconsensual sex, and most male victims reported female perpetrators"". I am a man, and I have rarely been sexually harassed by men, despite being in the theater program, in which only one other man is straight. I have been sexually harassed and assaulted by a few different women, one of whom showed me porn, flashed me and about four other people her tit,  twerked on a guy that I know, tried to twerk on me, and grabbed my dick, all while having a boyfriend at the time.. None of this was with consent, and none of it was enjoyed, despite the stereotype that male victims aren't victims because they like it. Sexual aggression is not related to sexism, it's related to feelings of power, which women want just as much as men.&#x200B;To be clear, I am not anti-feminist. I just think that many feminists do not know the challenges that men face, and rape of men not being taken seriously is one of the worst things about being a man.  Male rape victims have been ridiculed, told to ""Man up"", and forced to pay child support while their rapist gets to keep the child. [Example 1](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/09/02/statutory-rape-victim-child-support/14953965/), [Example 2](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/talking-about-trauma/201902/when-male-rape-victims-are-accountable-child-support)&#x200B;I **do not** intend to downplay any struggles that women face, and I have heard stories of male rapists getting custody of the victims child. But injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere, and ignoring injustice against men will not stop injustice against women. I am not anti-feminist pro-masculist, or anti-masculist pro-feminist. Simply put, I am pro-justice."	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609077070fcbf23df04c96f6	00016b18b2--609077070fcbf23df04c96f6	APPROVED

Not sure if it's necessity exactly, but my husband is from the EU and I'm American, and even though neither of us were totally wild on the concept of marriage (we literally eloped just the two of us last year because we aren't big on huge parties or celebrations for ourselves - love them for others though!), we knew down the line it'd be SO much easier to be and stay together being married than it would just being in a relationship. We've been together 6 years, married almost one, and are expecting our first child in November. We are super happy together and living in our third country/second continent together and the first time living in one of our home countries (his) together, and we love it. Sometimes it's just easier to take the plunge than to live with uncertainty over visas and legal issues that come from being a multi-culti couple.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--6090773519d8d52be2e1d4f0	00016b18b2--6090773519d8d52be2e1d4f0	APPROVED

This might be a dramatic response but I get so angry about this. They’re making a product to sell on the basis that our beauty isn’t quite enough— that it could be “enhanced,” or “accentuated.” Marketing people and bloggers love those words. They think they’re not offensive, but they are offensive. And the truth is that my face IS the most beautiful, perfect, intriguing version of my face there is. And the beauty industry has the audacity to say, “we can make you more beautiful.” On what authority? With what power? Their chemicals synthesized in sterile little labs are no match for the cosmic stardust that made up my face. What arrogance and what conceit to believe they know my beauty better than I do. To believe they can manipulate my sense of self and my confidence to convince me my beauty, my presence, and my power would be improved if I purchased a product from them or elected to have a procedure. And all their efforts to manipulate and brainwash are for the sole purpose of fattening their own wallets.	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609077a340338e07319d86d3	00016b18b2--609077a340338e07319d86d3	APPROVED

"Hey there! Congratulations on your beautiful transition into your True Self. This is absolutely feminism related and it's eeeeeeverywhere.Women don't signal their skillset because they're gonna end up fucking doing the work anyway. Men talk. ""If you want it talked about, ask a man. If you want it done, ask a woman."" - Margaret Thatcher Things like vocal fry, ending sentences as questions?  and verbal qualifiers (""is it just me, or..."" and ""that's just my opinion"" and literally saying ""I don't know"") are all noted throughout feminism as women consciously and unconsciously playing into their role within a heteronormative patriarchal capitalist society. To observe and report as a female that ""doesn't know,"" is less qualified, silent + pretty, ""knows her place,"" and, most importantly is there solely for men's pleasure and servitude is to continue to reinforce that patriarchy, *whether she is aware of it or not.*The women who have had to fight to be heard as equals, especially in the workplace, have been doing so for decades.Unequal pay has zero to do with any ""modesty"" and everything to do with patriarchy. For the .77 cents a white woman makes, a woman of color makes .40-.65 of that same dollar.

I empathize. I just want you to know that.Some men are able to truly be allies to women and see women as fully human. But they are depressingly rare.

"The use of female makes me cringe and while a lot of people are simply unaware or ignorant of why it is an issue they've also often internalized and rationalized the type of misogyny that goes with the use.To make it simple if someone uses male or female in the same manner in the purpose it's intended as an adjective to specify gender as in : female police officer, male firefighter. It's the normal use of the term.If someone uses men/females or man/female it is inherently sexist. It's dehumanizing in the same manner that calling a Black person ""a Black"" is dehumanizing. They literally take the personhood away from individuals or groups they consider beneath men. Both men and women can be misogynistic and can consider women beneath men just like anyone can be racist, internalized misogyny is really common. So even if a woman uses it doesn't make it ""not sexist"". There's no free pass here.If someone uses male/female or females/males in the same place it's not necessarily problematic but really if someone can use the terms for human male and human female that are Woman/Man correctly why not use them?Tldr: Male/Female should be used as an adjective to indicate gender specifically.Woman/man should be used as a noun for it's intended purpose human male = man, human female = woman.PS: it's particularly striking in some other languages where no one would dream of calling a woman by a term usually reserved for biology or other species of animal. One might as well straight up call a woman a Cow or Bitch as that is how it can be perceived."	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609077c85549355605fac0b7	00016b18b2--609077c85549355605fac0b7	APPROVED

It's a huge problem in Nigeria, the welfare groups and the police act independently, and that's if at all they take any action. The overwhelming majority do not attempt reporting out of fear of retribution from their attackers, being blamed and turned away, or severely mishandled by the police. If the welfare groups had more building fronts and activists, more women would be aware that they exist and turn to them for help. The police are dependant on the activists to basically settle cases. But there are just not enough volunteers or money. They were just discussing on NPR not too long ago. It's heart breaking and puts things in perspective.

I haven't found a lot of value in looking for the perfect cishet man ally. Instead I've had more success finding ones who are willing to lend their privilege and do work in a specific area, and then directing that work or connecting them with marginalized people who can direct their work. I don't assess my friends on a woke/ally scale but I do gravitate towards people with shared values, without expecting them (or me) to be perfect - just open to growth.	1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609077eb5549355605fac22f	00016b18b2--609077eb5549355605fac22f	APPROVED
The problem here though is that Joe Biden could take the high road but the sitting Orange in Chief has already taken the low(est) road.The [Summer Zervos lawsuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_sexual_misconduct_allegations#Summer_Zervos_(2007) is still on-going and Trump were supposed to testify January 31. There's an ongoing trial about a woman who wants to be believed. There was also a civil lawsuit that alleged that Trump [raped a 13 year old](https://www.snopes.com/news/2016/06/23/donald-trump-rape-lawsuit/).I'm not defending Biden, as a non-US citizen I have no horse in this race, aside from Trump being what I consider a global threat.

The best argument they have is “women are payed less then men in the same job, at the same company”.

If I work saturdays, take extra jobs during the week, and don’t take time off I can make a shit load more money if someone shows up for 40 hours a week.If they can come up with a stat that shows men make more than women in the same position, same experience, with the same hours worked, at the same company, then we can talk.	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609077f3e313a106d827e44b	00016b18b2--609077f3e313a106d827e44b	APPROVED
I agree that womens issues have to be talked about when refering to sexism.However so do mens? They definitely could have included more examples and stats on issues men face, as these aren't talked about nearly enough.

"Hi, this submission has been removed.

We appreciate your participation on r/WitchesVsPatriarchy. Unfortunately, this particular post has been removed in an effort to better curate our content and reinforce the aspects of this sub that make it unique. /r/WitchesVsPatriarchy is a woman-centered sub with a witchy twist, aimed at healing, supporting, and uplifting one another through humor and magic. It's not mandatory for posts to have both a witchy theme and a feminist theme. However our goal is to become a haven from hatred online, so we especially value posts that have a positive/uplifting or humorous vibe. Posts calling out or taking shots at other groups are discouraged unless they implicitly offer a remedy. While we deeply understand the value of calling out groups for harmful behavior, there are other existing subs better suited for that type of content. We hope you understand and continue to participate within our guidelines 🙂

You just have to search a little harder. While technology has evolved to allow the feminist view to scream over everything else, the ministry of truth has not yet been able to eliminate all past knowledge. It's there if you look for it. And sometimes it's simply a matter of looking a little closer at the feminist interpretation, which tends to contradict itself quite a lot.

In an attempt to appear sex-positive, we’ve ignored the many interviews from ex-pornstars about the atrocities committed against them in the name of porn and how many porn actors said they needed drugs to keep doing the scenes.

I'm a celibate virgin who has thought of adoption, surrogacy, and artificial insemination as substitutes for traditional fatherhood. Adoption may be the easiest of the 3 because there's usually always an orphan or fatherless child in a society. I'm thinking of adoption though some societies might not want to give kids to men as much as give kids to women.Have you looked into the laws of surrogacy before considering it? Just as there are laws governing adoption and marriage, there may be laws governing surrogacy. Surrogacy also might mean your having sex with a woman, so you'd have to be mindful of sex laws and false rape accusations. Outside of that, surrogacy may be fine. If your family is willing to help you raise the child, then childcare may not be an issue either.	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609078b37d9ddc487d523c53	00016b18b2--609078b37d9ddc487d523c53	APPROVED

It's a huge problem in Nigeria, the welfare groups and the police act independently, and that's if at all they take any action. The overwhelming majority do not attempt reporting out of fear of retribution from their attackers, being blamed and turned away, or severely mishandled by the police. If the welfare groups had more building fronts and activists, more women would be aware that they exist and turn to them for help. The police are dependant on the activists to basically settle cases. But there are just not enough volunteers or money. They were just discussing on NPR not too long ago. It's heart breaking and puts things in perspective.

In an attempt to appear sex-positive, we’ve ignored the many interviews from ex-pornstars about the atrocities committed against them in the name of porn and how many porn actors said they needed drugs to keep doing the scenes.

"Hi, this submission has been removed.

We appreciate your participation on r/WitchesVsPatriarchy. Unfortunately, this particular post has been removed in an effort to better curate our content and reinforce the aspects of this sub that make it unique. /r/WitchesVsPatriarchy is a woman-centered sub with a witchy twist, aimed at healing, supporting, and uplifting one another through humor and magic. It's not mandatory for posts to have both a witchy theme and a feminist theme. However our goal is to become a haven from hatred online, so we especially value posts that have a positive/uplifting or humorous vibe. Posts calling out or taking shots at other groups are discouraged unless they implicitly offer a remedy. While we deeply understand the value of calling out groups for harmful behavior, there are other existing subs better suited for that type of content. We hope you understand and continue to participate within our guidelines 🙂

I'm a celibate virgin who has thought of adoption, surrogacy, and artificial insemination as substitutes for traditional fatherhood. Adoption may be the easiest of the 3 because there's usually always an orphan or fatherless child in a society. I'm thinking of adoption though some societies might not want to give kids to men as much as give kids to women.Have you looked into the laws of surrogacy before considering it? Just as there are laws governing adoption and marriage, there may be laws governing surrogacy. Surrogacy also might mean your having sex with a woman, so you'd have to be mindful of sex laws and false rape accusations. Outside of that, surrogacy may be fine. If your family is willing to help you raise the child, then childcare may not be an issue either.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609079e9ca4cce13cb2f74df	00016b18b2--609079e9ca4cce13cb2f74df	APPROVED

The best argument they have is “women are payed less then men in the same job, at the same company”.

It's a huge problem in Nigeria, the welfare groups and the police act independently, and that's if at all they take any action. The overwhelming majority do not attempt reporting out of fear of retribution from their attackers, being blamed and turned away, or severely mishandled by the police. If the welfare groups had more building fronts and activists, more women would be aware that they exist and turn to them for help. The police are dependant on the activists to basically settle cases. But there are just not enough volunteers or money. They were just discussing on NPR not too long ago. It's heart breaking and puts things in perspective.

"let me just copy and paste real quickedit: So what you're saying is that you, a commenter using a username on an internet forum are the true feminist, and the feminists actually responsible for changing the laws, writing the academic theory, teaching the courses, influencing the public policies, and the massive, well-funded feminist organizations with thousands and thousands of members all of whom call themselves feminists... they are not ""real feminists""? You're not the director of the Feminist Majority Foundation and editor of Ms. Magazine, Katherine Spillar, who said of domestic violence: ""Well, that's just a clean-up word for wife-beating,"" and went on to add that regarding male victims of dating violence, ""we know it's not girls beating up boys, it's boys beating up girls.""You're not Jan Reimer, former mayor of Edmonton and long-time head of Alberta's Network of Women's Shelters, who just a few years ago refused to appear on a TV program discussing male victims of domestic violence, because for her to even show up and discuss it would lend legitimacy to the idea that they exist.You're not Mary P Koss, who describes male victims of female rapists in her academic papers as being not rape victims because they were ""ambivalent about their sexual desires"" (if you don't know what that means, it's that they actually wanted it), and then went on to define them out of the definition of rape in the CDC's research because it's inappropriate to consider what happened to them rape.You're not the National Organization for Women, and its associated legal foundations, who lobbied to replace the gender neutral federal Family Violence Prevention and Services Act of 1984 with the obscenely gendered Violence Against Women Act of 1994. The passing of that law cut male victims out of support services and legal assistance in more than 60 passages, just because they were male.You're not the Florida chapter of the NOW, who successfully lobbied to have Governor Rick Scott veto not one, but two alimony reform bills in the last ten years, bills that had passed both houses with overwhelming bipartisan support, and were supported by more than 70% of the electorate.You're not the feminist group in Maryland who convinced every female member of the House on both sides of the aisle to walk off the floor when a shared parenting bill came up for a vote, meaning the quorum could not be met and the bill died then and there.You're not the feminists in Canada agitating to remove sexual assault from the normal criminal courts, into quasi-criminal courts of equity where the burden of proof would be lowered, the defendant could be compelled to testify, discovery would go both ways, and defendants would not be entitled to a public defender.You're not Professor Elizabeth Sheehy, who wrote a book advocating that women not only have the right to murder their husbands without fear of prosecution if they make a claim of abuse, but that they have the moral responsibility to murder their husbands.You're not the feminist legal scholars and advocates who successfully changed rape laws such that a woman's history of making multiple false allegations of rape can be excluded from evidence at trial because it's ""part of her sexual history.""You're not the feminists who splattered the media with the false claim that putting your penis in a passed-out woman's mouth is ""not a crime"" in Oklahoma, because the prosecutor was incompetent and charged the defendant under an inappropriate statute (forcible sodomy) and the higher court refused to expand the definition of that statute beyond its intended scope when there was already a perfectly good one (sexual battery) already there. You're not the idiot feminists lying to the public and potentially putting women in Oklahoma at risk by telling potential offenders there's a ""legal"" way to rape them.And you're none of the hundreds or thousands of feminist scholars, writers, thinkers, researchers, teachers and philosophers who constructed and propagate the body of bunkum theories upon which all of these atrocities are based.No...You're the true feminist.

This pushes my buttons for so many reasons.* It seems to show positive masculinity as non-gender-specific traits.

This happens to me all the time. In high school boys would not move out of the way in the hallways. I'm not proud of it but I would purposely stick out my elbows so they would run into them. In college, some people would try to walk two or three people wide on the sidewalk. Normally I wouldn't mind stepping off on the grass - depending on what shoes I was wearing. If I wearing shoes that I minded getting muddy or snowy, I just simply refused to move. And a lot of the time, that meant the other person would collide with the side of my backpack. But it was usually other girls that wouldn't move over even if they were just wearing sneakers or flip flops.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--60907a3b96495b392fd12438	00016b18b2--60907a3b96495b392fd12438	APPROVED

We appreciate your participation on r/WitchesVsPatriarchy. Unfortunately, this particular post has been removed in an effort to better curate our content and reinforce the aspects of this sub that make it unique. /r/WitchesVsPatriarchy is a woman-centered sub with a witchy twist, aimed at healing, supporting, and uplifting one another through humor and magic. It's not mandatory for posts to have both a witchy theme and a feminist theme. However our goal is to become a haven from hatred online, so we especially value posts that have a positive/uplifting or humorous vibe. Posts calling out or taking shots at other groups are discouraged unless they implicitly offer a remedy. While we deeply understand the value of calling out groups for harmful behavior, there are other existing subs better suited for that type of content. We hope you understand and continue to participate within our guidelines 🙂

The best argument they have is “women are payed less then men in the same job, at the same company”.

"The use of female makes me cringe and while a lot of people are simply unaware or ignorant of why it is an issue they've also often internalized and rationalized the type of misogyny that goes with the use.To make it simple if someone uses male or female in the same manner in the purpose it's intended as an adjective to specify gender as in : female police officer, male firefighter. It's the normal use of the term.If someone uses men/females or man/female it is inherently sexist. It's dehumanizing in the same manner that calling a Black person ""a Black"" is dehumanizing. They literally take the personhood away from individuals or groups they consider beneath men. Both men and women can be misogynistic and can consider women beneath men just like anyone can be racist, internalized misogyny is really common. So even if a woman uses it doesn't make it ""not sexist"". There's no free pass here.If someone uses male/female or females/males in the same place it's not necessarily problematic but really if someone can use the terms for human male and human female that are Woman/Man correctly why not use them?Tldr: Male/Female should be used as an adjective to indicate gender specifically.Woman/man should be used as a noun for it's intended purpose human male = man, human female = woman.PS: it's particularly striking in some other languages where no one would dream of calling a woman by a term usually reserved for biology or other species of animal. One might as well straight up call a woman a Cow or Bitch as that is how it can be perceived."	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--60907c109fe36f17d7cd2a75	00016b18b2--60907c109fe36f17d7cd2a75	APPROVED

This pushes my buttons for so many reasons.* It seems to show positive masculinity as non-gender-specific traits. If positive masculinity means men and women have the same characteristics and traits, how is that masculinity? And this in the context of 'toxic masculinity' which is gender-specific.* The UN posts about men only when it is about benefiting women* It reduces men's human rights issues down to trivialities. It actually undermines addressing systemic issues facing men by shifting the focus away from them.Edit: It also means that positive masculinity is not the norm.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--60907c523831085841434cbd	00016b18b2--60907c523831085841434cbd	APPROVED

It is difficult to say because in lesbian relationships, there are two possible victims and two possible perpetrators. In straight relationships, there is only one possible victim and one possible perpetrator. By saying this, I don't mean that men cannot be abused.

I think you should speak to the lawyer and sue the school for damages.Especially the principal who clearly acted in a biased way. Include 'abby's'  name in your complain, despite of people advising you not to.Dont speak to anybody. Distance yourself from all the friends (except those who at least tried to understand your side of the story). Record what they say to you. It can be used against them.You will have greater success suing the school and the accuser together. Instead of trying to prove yourself. If you need to prove yourself anyways, better to do it in court and get a compensation.	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--60907c99bb4ccb009f9b8cb9	00016b18b2--60907c99bb4ccb009f9b8cb9	APPROVED

This happens to me all the time. In high school boys would not move out of the way in the hallways. I'm not proud of it but I would purposely stick out my elbows so they would run into them. In college, some people would try to walk two or three people wide on the sidewalk. Normally I wouldn't mind stepping off on the grass - depending on what shoes I was wearing. If I wearing shoes that I minded getting muddy or snowy, I just simply refused to move. And a lot of the time, that meant the other person would collide with the side of my backpack. But it was usually other girls that wouldn't move over even if they were just wearing sneakers or flip flops.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--60907cadd2eb476f06323a21	00016b18b2--60907cadd2eb476f06323a21	APPROVED

I'm going with a not very romantic option here but my SO and I are at a point in our life where marriage will make it easier to protect our finances and assets, especially in the worst cases like in illness or a death.

Especially as I have a family that would happily screw him over if something happened to me.Of course it's taken us 10 years of a very happy and loving relationship to get to this point where we feel confident in embracing those legal rights.

 I am man and I truly believe women are my equals.That's why women asking for special protection is absolute bullshit.Women: You've been telling me my entire life that you can do anything men can (if not better); time to put your money where your mouth is and learn to defend yourselves the same way men have since the dawn of time.You're strong, independent people who don't need me to fight your battles!

This pushes my buttons for so many reasons.* It seems to show positive masculinity as non-gender-specific traits. If positive masculinity means men and women have the same characteristics and traits, how is that masculinity? And this in the context of 'toxic masculinity' which is gender-specific.* The UN posts about men only when it is about benefiting women* It reduces men's human rights issues down to trivialities. It actually undermines addressing systemic issues facing men by shifting the focus away from them.Edit: It also means that positive masculinity is not the norm.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--60907e224a2a15762236951f	00016b18b2--60907e224a2a15762236951f	APPROVED

Being there and consistently stepping up in the hardest of times. I’m a very independent person and don’t require a lot of daily support or general emotional labor. But when something terrible happens and I’m at my most vulnerable (we had a tricky birth of our first child for example, or a close family member dying) he is literal Superman and I trust him with my life and to be my most broken self with him in those moments. He’s never let me down, not a single time when I’ve needed him the most.	1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--60907e7104eb6219ecd8a3eb	00016b18b2--60907e7104eb6219ecd8a3eb	APPROVED

You just have to search a little harder. While technology has evolved to allow the feminist view to scream over everything else, the ministry of truth has not yet been able to eliminate all past knowledge. It's there if you look for it. And sometimes it's simply a matter of looking a little closer at the feminist interpretation, which tends to contradict itself quite a lot.

This happens to me all the time. In high school boys would not move out of the way in the hallways. I'm not proud of it but I would purposely stick out my elbows so they would run into them. In college, some people would try to walk two or three people wide on the sidewalk. Normally I wouldn't mind stepping off on the grass - depending on what shoes I was wearing. If I wearing shoes that I minded getting muddy or snowy, I just simply refused to move. And a lot of the time, that meant the other person would collide with the side of my backpack. But it was usually other girls that wouldn't move over even if they were just wearing sneakers or flip flops.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609080125614113712f40843	00016b18b2--609080125614113712f40843	APPROVED

I think you should stop framing this as a far left thing. I'm fairly far left and this is not remotely normal.

Okay first no guy says, I really like that girl but dam it I'm not ready for how smart she is. Your statement in the second paragraph is why you're alone, you can't imply that you're smarter then your date and that's why he didn't want you, thats like saying I'm perfect even when I'm not, you can't connect with someone assuming you're generally better and they are generally not, now the black thing, I hate this, I am half black, long story short, you could tell I'm mixed but I could be anything but Chinese or white if you see me, with that said I've dated all types of women, the black girls that I like, don't think they are disadvantaged because of it, they are not victims for being black, yes you have to work through other peoples stereotypes like I do but those stereotypes do not define you, I tell a girl I'm black and the first thing they say is I don't act black , your lying or they believe I'm more likely to cheat because they or someone they know has been cheated on by a black guy, I even slept with a girl once that was so racist that she got mad when she found out I was black after, it happens.

It bothers me a lot that many doctors tell women it is fine to skip the sugar pills and just take the hormonal pills back to back to skip periods. Yes I know the sugar pills are medically unnecessary and were simply included to mimic natural cycles. But there has also been little to no research on the side effects of taking the pill continuously. These pills can have some pretty serious side effects and the doctor is basically telling women to take a 25% higher dose than intended, often with absolutely no extra physical checkup or follow up. There have been no long term high population studies on women who take the pill as intended vs skipping the sugar pill. I think women are dosing themselves into all kinds of future trouble with many kinds of BC.	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--6090810faae37140692d10aa	00016b18b2--6090810faae37140692d10aa	APPROVED

"The meme absolutely only functions because of sexism, but it's also an interesting phenomenon to think about intersectional concerns. There's a legitimate critique to made about how Middle-class white women largely abet other forms of oppression, and the term is often used by oppressed people to punch upwards. Really interesting in this article, I think, is the discussion of class.

"A lot of people are trying ""but what about trans people?"".Well, gender confirmation/reassignment surgery is a reconstruction procedure. Not cosmetic procedure. And we shouldn't misinterpret and jeopardize trans people's human rights. As a society, we should understand the difference between medically unnecessary elective procedure which serve no purpose and medically necessary surgical procedures which save people's lives, cure people, increase their survival chances and improve their health. GRS is a clinically indicated procedure supported by medical evidence and experts to treat a recognized medical condition. It may involve cosmetic procedures (but so is other medically  necessary procedures)on one level, but it is clearly very wrong to brand it as cosmetic procedure.[Quality of life improves early after gender reassignment surgery in transgender women](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5440516/) [Transgender surgery can improve life for most, study confirms](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.medicalnewstoday.com/amp/articles/321258)[Sex-reassignment surgery yields long-term mental health benefits, study finds.The longer ago a transgender person’s gender-affirming surgery, the less likely they are to suffer anxiety, depression or suicidal behavior, the study suggests](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna1079911) https://eau18.uroweb.org/first-accurate-data-showing-transgender-surgery-can-lead-to-a-better-life/"	1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--6090813019d8d52be2e281ce	00016b18b2--6090813019d8d52be2e281ce	APPROVED

It bothers me a lot that many doctors tell women it is fine to skip the sugar pills and just take the hormonal pills back to back to skip periods. Yes I know the sugar pills are medically unnecessary and were simply included to mimic natural cycles. But there has also been little to no research on the side effects of taking the pill continuously. These pills can have some pretty serious side effects and the doctor is basically telling women to take a 25% higher dose than intended, often with absolutely no extra physical checkup or follow up. There have been no long term high population studies on women who take the pill as intended vs skipping the sugar pill. I think women are dosing themselves into all kinds of future trouble with many kinds of BC.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--6090817ae313a106d82885e9	00016b18b2--6090817ae313a106d82885e9	APPROVED

"The meme absolutely only functions because of sexism, but it's also an interesting phenomenon to think about intersectional concerns.

Positively. My dad has some flaws, as we all do but for the most part, he was Superman. He could fix anything, he could cook amazing food, he was kind, he made friends everywhere he went, he loved teaching me, and most of all, I was his grand prize. All of this meant that I sought a partner who was many of those things. I also knew how it felt to be shown love and respect. On the other hand, my dad simple wasn’t close to my big sister. They just didn’t have the same connection and butt heads a lot. My sister notoriously dates bad boys and/or losers. She admits this herself. It’s as if I gravitate towards the best parts of my dad and my sister gravitates towards the worst parts of my dad. My dad back in the day was a bad boy, was selfish, and jealous. My sister did have positive male role models in her life in my uncles. But, it’s hard to feel rejection from your own father; especially, when you see he is capable of being loving. They are closer now but I certainly do believe a dad has an impact of your choice of romantic partners to an extent. My advice to all men: be the man you would want your daughter to date.	1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--60908199f941c07be7ba975f	00016b18b2--60908199f941c07be7ba975f	APPROVED

It is difficult to say because in lesbian relationships, there are two possible victims and two possible perpetrators. In straight relationships, there is only one possible victim and one possible perpetrator. By saying this, I don't mean that men cannot be abused.

I think you should speak to the lawyer and sue the school for damages.Especially the principal who clearly acted in a biased way. Include 'abby's'  name in your complain, despite of people advising you not to.Dont speak to anybody. Distance yourself from all the friends (except those who at least tried to understand your side of the story). Record what they say to you. It can be used against them.You will have greater success suing the school and the accuser together. Instead of trying to prove yourself. If you need to prove yourself anyways, better to do it in court and get a compensation.	1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609081a5d2eb476f0632670a	00016b18b2--609081a5d2eb476f0632670a	APPROVED

This might be a dramatic response but I get so angry about this. They’re making a product to sell on the basis that our beauty isn’t quite enough— that it could be “enhanced,” or “accentuated.” Marketing people and bloggers love those words. They think they’re not offensive, but they are offensive. And the truth is that my face IS the most beautiful, perfect, intriguing version of my face there is. And the beauty industry has the audacity to say, “we can make you more beautiful.” On what authority? With what power? Their chemicals synthesized in sterile little labs are no match for the cosmic stardust that made up my face. What arrogance and what conceit to believe they know my beauty better than I do. To believe they can manipulate my sense of self and my confidence to convince me my beauty, my presence, and my power would be improved if I purchased a product from them or elected to have a procedure. And all their efforts to manipulate and brainwash are for the sole purpose of fattening their own wallets.	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609081ef96495b392fd1cf95	00016b18b2--609081ef96495b392fd1cf95	APPROVED

Yep. The number of times people have pointed to this or that porn star as proof that the industry can be empowering or ethical, and then a few years later that same woman comes out about the abuse she experienced and the trauma she's enduring as a result.

"Hey there! Congratulations on your beautiful transition into your True Self.

If you want it done, ask a woman."" - Margaret Thatcher Things like vocal fry, ending sentences as questions?  and verbal qualifiers (""is it just me, or..."" and ""that's just my opinion"" and literally saying ""I don't know"") are all noted throughout feminism as women consciously and unconsciously playing into their role within a heteronormative patriarchal capitalist society. To observe and report as a female that ""doesn't know,"" is less qualified, silent + pretty, ""knows her place,"" and, most importantly is there solely for men's pleasure and servitude is to continue to reinforce that patriarchy, *whether she is aware of it or not.*The women who have had to fight to be heard as equals, especially in the workplace, have been doing so for decades.Unequal pay has zero to do with any ""modesty"" and everything to do with patriarchy.

You just have to search a little harder. While technology has evolved to allow the feminist view to scream over everything else, the ministry of truth has not yet been able to eliminate all past knowledge. It's there if you look for it. And sometimes it's simply a matter of looking a little closer at the feminist interpretation, which tends to contradict itself quite a lot.

It’s up to all of us, right here and right now, to demand better. The form that demand takes is going to vary from individual to individual, but we absolutely owe it to ourselves and every woman who came before us that we don’t let go of the freedoms they fought for. Ask more of partners who are able to participate in household tasks. Write to policy makers asking them to reconsider their policies in this light. Write to any workers union you might belong to.

I don’t have children but I do have a sister with children, and she has been experiencing exactly what you’re experiencing. She has 4 boys (ranging from 3 to 10) and a full time job. She and my brother-in-law have both been working from home during lockdown but it’s my sister who has had to juggle work, childcare/entertainment, housework and cooking meals. Every time she asks my brother-in-law to watch his own children so she can go on a call, he argues that he’s about to go on a work call too or has an important email to write, as if his work is intrinsically more important than hers. He’s even complained more than once that dinner is late.... she’s told me if it wasn’t for Covid, she’d have kicked him out by now. I feel for both you and her.

Well, the statement is poorly made since it's incomplete.Where do you want to apply this concept of equality? In many cases it's simply impossible.

The police took me to the hospital (I was 15) and brought me through the back to get checked out. I told them I didn’t want my parents to know. Just my luck, my dad was there for a nose bleed, they saw me in the hall. Did a rape kit, for some medication to prevent HIV, took plan B and then gave a statement to the police. It took over a year to go trial. Met with a victim service worker who wasn’t very helpful and with the crown attorney a few times. A private investigator followed me around a few times and tried to question me and people I knew about me to get dirt on me. I was bullied really badly in high school and got into drugs and drinking. Lost a lot of friends and my family split. In the end one guy was plead guilty and was given 3 years (only because he was 26 and had raped 10 other girls, most minors) and the other got off with nothing. He ended up walking around town with a knife trying to find me but the cops got him and I had a restraining order put against him. I regret coming forward personally but I can see how it would be positive for some people. For me it just dragged out the experience and caused a lot more problems. Unfortunately I was sexually assaulted again at 21 and I’ve never told anyone and never will.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--6090823019d8d52be2e28a0e	00016b18b2--6090823019d8d52be2e28a0e	APPROVED

Positively. My dad has some flaws, as we all do but for the most part, he was Superman. He could fix anything, he could cook amazing food, he was kind, he made friends everywhere he went, he loved teaching me, and most of all, I was his grand prize. All of this meant that I sought a partner who was many of those things. I also knew how it felt to be shown love and respect. On the other hand, my dad simple wasn’t close to my big sister. They just didn’t have the same connection and butt heads a lot. My sister notoriously dates bad boys and/or losers. She admits this herself. It’s as if I gravitate towards the best parts of my dad and my sister gravitates towards the worst parts of my dad. My dad back in the day was a bad boy, was selfish, and jealous. My sister did have positive male role models in her life in my uncles. But, it’s hard to feel rejection from your own father; especially, when you see he is capable of being loving. They are closer now but I certainly do believe a dad has an impact of your choice of romantic partners to an extent. My advice to all men: be the man you would want your daughter to date.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609082319fe36f17d7cd6f8d	00016b18b2--609082319fe36f17d7cd6f8d	APPROVED

"(Self nude representation) I think it's a matter of personal opinionWith the female empowerment movement we see women being more open with their sexuality, sex work, nudes etc. It can be seen empowering as women are shamed for these things. By doing them instead of being afraid of being shamed. Women are essentially taking back the power of their bodies etc.*However*, there are ways it can be seen as there still being exploited.Women who share their nudes openly and willingly, or take part in porn (e.g. only fans) is pushed as being empowering. But ultimately, they're still just being sexualised by men. What women share will be used by men for sexual gratification. So is this not women still being sexually exploited but they're made to believe its empowering?The same can be applied to women being more open with casual sex. It is seen as empowering because they're taking control of their sexuality, they're defying the slut shaming and going out there and doing what they want.But then there is the orgasm gap between men and women, meaning when women hook up, they're likely to leave without ever having an orgasm, but he almost always finishes. So we say women hooking up is sexually empowering...but...they're not being pleased, only he is. So are women not just being exploited still, but we are just made to believe by society that it is something we want in the name of empowerment? *Conclusion* It all depends on your personal view of things.- women sharing nudes is sexually empowering because they're claiming back power.- women sharing nudes is sexually exploiting them still because those photos are going to be used for mens sexual gratification. Thus they are still being exploited by men, and are ""empowered"" to keep sharing all so men can be benefitted more easily."	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--6090825c40338e07319df914	00016b18b2--6090825c40338e07319df914	APPROVED

I empathize. I just want you to know that.Some men are able to truly be allies to women and see women as fully human. But they are depressingly rare. Most men won't take women's perspectives seriously. It's like men's testimony is fine to them but women's holds no weight. It's so fucked up. I'm so sick of it too. I don't know what the solution is for you, but do what you need to do. If separatism is what will help you feel safer and stronger, then go for it.

"The use of female makes me cringe and while a lot of people are simply unaware or ignorant of why it is an issue they've also often internalized and rationalized the type of misogyny that goes with the use.To make it simple if someone uses male or female in the same manner in the purpose it's intended as an adjective to specify gender as in : female police officer, male firefighter. It's the normal use of the term.If someone uses men/females or man/female it is inherently sexist. It's dehumanizing in the same manner that calling a Black person ""a Black"" is dehumanizing. They literally take the personhood away from individuals or groups they consider beneath men. Both men and women can be misogynistic and can consider women beneath men just like anyone can be racist, internalized misogyny is really common. So even if a woman uses it doesn't make it ""not sexist"". There's no free pass here.If someone uses male/female or females/males in the same place it's not necessarily problematic but really if someone can use the terms for human male and human female that are Woman/Man correctly why not use them?Tldr: Male/Female should be used as an adjective to indicate gender specifically.Woman/man should be used as a noun for it's intended purpose human male = man, human female = woman.PS: it's particularly striking in some other languages where no one would dream of calling a woman by a term usually reserved for biology or other species of animal. One might as well straight up call a woman a Cow or Bitch as that is how it can be perceived."	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609082755614113712f48d29	00016b18b2--609082755614113712f48d29	APPROVED

Positively. My dad has some flaws, as we all do but for the most part, he was Superman. He could fix anything, he could cook amazing food, he was kind, he made friends everywhere he went, he loved teaching me, and most of all, I was his grand prize. All of this meant that I sought a partner who was many of those things. I also knew how it felt to be shown love and respect. On the other hand, my dad simple wasn’t close to my big sister. They just didn’t have the same connection and butt heads a lot. My sister notoriously dates bad boys and/or losers. She admits this herself. It’s as if I gravitate towards the best parts of my dad and my sister gravitates towards the worst parts of my dad. My dad back in the day was a bad boy, was selfish, and jealous. My sister did have positive male role models in her life in my uncles. But, it’s hard to feel rejection from your own father; especially, when you see he is capable of being loving. They are closer now but I certainly do believe a dad has an impact of your choice of romantic partners to an extent. My advice to all men: be the man you would want your daughter to date.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609082935614113712f49458	00016b18b2--609082935614113712f49458	APPROVED

"(Self nude representation) I think it's a matter of personal opinionWith the female empowerment movement we see women being more open with their sexuality, sex work, nudes etc. It can be seen empowering as women are shamed for these things. By doing them instead of being afraid of being shamed. Women are essentially taking back the power of their bodies etc.*However*, there are ways it can be seen as there still being exploited.Women who share their nudes openly and willingly, or take part in porn (e.g. only fans) is pushed as being empowering. But ultimately, they're still just being sexualised by men. What women share will be used by men for sexual gratification. So is this not women still being sexually exploited but they're made to believe its empowering?The same can be applied to women being more open with casual sex. It is seen as empowering because they're taking control of their sexuality, they're defying the slut shaming and going out there and doing what they want.But then there is the orgasm gap between men and women, meaning when women hook up, they're likely to leave without ever having an orgasm, but he almost always finishes. So we say women hooking up is sexually empowering...but...they're not being pleased, only he is. So are women not just being exploited still, but we are just made to believe by society that it is something we want in the name of empowerment? *Conclusion* It all depends on your personal view of things.- women sharing nudes is sexually empowering because they're claiming back power.- women sharing nudes is sexually exploiting them still because those photos are going to be used for mens sexual gratification. Thus they are still being exploited by men, and are ""empowered"" to keep sharing all so men can be benefitted more easily."	1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609082b204eb6219ecd8c5f3	00016b18b2--609082b204eb6219ecd8c5f3	APPROVED

"If they say not all men, and turn around to victim blame women it pretty much paints men as immature sex trolls. I'm a sex troll myself, but if i see a women or man wearing a bikini in a store, using their ass to hold groceries I'm going to ask first. I'll never assume consent until i know that persons interests, even then it's going to have to be clear.

Turkey is slowly becoming the new epicenter of Islamic expansion. EU needs to check this at any cost.Earlier when Syria was the epicenter, Turkey was the buffer land between it and EU.

Yes because if someone loses their income they'll just become a teacher or a nurse. It's not like those jobs require qualifications that they may not have or that unemployment still remains a huge problem effecting millions. Just get a job it's that simple.Thinking the sex work industry is something that ideally shouldn't exist is fine, but you can't ignore the underlining problems that cause it to exist in the first place. People aren't choosing to go into sex work because they haven't realised that there are other jobs out there.	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--60908303078ece51891d0d8d	00016b18b2--60908303078ece51891d0d8d	APPROVED

"It is tiring, and it's ok to take a break sometimes. Just go do your own hobbies and try not to focus on the shit things going on around the world.Also, I find that there's no use debating people who are arguing in bad faith. Usually people who complain about ""men's issues"" in response to someone talking about women's issues don't actually care about either. If they did, they'd probably just google it and see very fast that feminism *will* help men - not that this should matter imo, I think elevating women's suffering should be enough for it to be a worthwhile cause. Not everything has to benifit men. Women don't complain when they see prostate cancer research being done, because they didn't grow up with the idea that everything has to be for them.I get tired too, and it's hard to tell who's arguing in bad faith and who actually wants to be educated.

I'm really looking forward to reading bell hooks but this analysis troubles me. Advocating for a specific demographic will automatically oppress other demographics? Aiming to have the same privilege as the high status demographic means I must take others' privilege away? Seems so 'zero-sum' and absolutist.Maybe I'm reading this the wrong way, but I don't agree with these blanket statements. I can work on fighting sexism and racism at the same time just like I can walk and chew gum. Raising awareness of my lack of privilege doesn't require me to harm others. What an odd notion.

"Hello! I've been working at my first job for a few months now. It has been wonderful, everyone I met try their best to be inclusive, and the company truly cares about diversity and equal opportunities and it shows.Except... I've started to notice that a colleague (Guy A) that works very closely to me (and also considered by me a not-so-close 'friend') tends to say discriminating things very subtly.I've had someone say something quite rude to me when I started work, and at that time I couldn't control my emotions (read: tears) so I just left the room. I'm in good terms with that person but this Guy A has been telling other people that he's scared to ask me for help because I'll react that way.If I look at myself objectively, I used to be hot headed sometimes, but gosh, I've never shouted, snapped, made a rude/snarky comment to anyone in the co. If anything I thought I adore the people I work with so I was always careful with how I react. If I feel like crying, I'll just walk out saying I'm unwell or something, although that never even happened twice.I try not to be too close to this guy despite us sharing mutual friends because of the kind of rude remarks he makes. He once got upset that someone said something 'feminist' during a large event (context - someone said thank you for including female characters in an exercise we were doing...). He downright asked me if I had plastic surgery (first person to ask me that). He told me my job and my role is not very core to the team while he's is. He believes in the 'girls bringing girls down' narrative and subtly tries to pit girls against each other by comparing their looks. He asks me ""how much did you buy *something ""fancy"" like a Starbucks drink*"" with a judgemental tone.But I've been noticing a more disturbing thing he's doing recently which is framing women around her who show emotions (negative ones especially) or speak up assertively as ""scary"" and hard to approach. I've also noticed that he likes girls who are super nice and smiley as friends and judges girls who may not smile all the time or express their preferences.Do I want to be his friend? I can pass. Do I want to confront him? Hard pass. But we have so many mutual friends and it's such a tightly knit community that I can't avoid him forever. Oh, and we work together. What surprises me the most is that I brushed off most of these red flags so far and actually thought that he was a good friend, a good 'bro' material.How do I deal with these kind of people?"	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--60908317d2eb476f063273ba	00016b18b2--60908317d2eb476f063273ba	APPROVED

It’s up to all of us, right here and right now, to demand better. The form that demand takes is going to vary from individual to individual, but we absolutely owe it to ourselves and every woman who came before us that we don’t let go of the freedoms they fought for. Ask more of partners who are able to participate in household tasks. Write to policy makers asking them to reconsider their policies in this light. Write to any workers union you might belong to.

I don’t have children but I do have a sister with children, and she has been experiencing exactly what you’re experiencing. She has 4 boys (ranging from 3 to 10) and a full time job. She and my brother-in-law have both been working from home during lockdown but it’s my sister who has had to juggle work, childcare/entertainment, housework and cooking meals. Every time she asks my brother-in-law to watch his own children so she can go on a call, he argues that he’s about to go on a work call too or has an important email to write, as if his work is intrinsically more important than hers. He’s even complained more than once that dinner is late.... she’s told me if it wasn’t for Covid, she’d have kicked him out by now. I feel for both you and her.

And dating someone so much older is generally ill advised. With the app thing you realize women get 70 matches in the time it takes the average guy to get 1. Datimg apps are demoralizing period. Why not make a profile as a guy and see how it goes?	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--60908383d2eb476f063277b9	00016b18b2--60908383d2eb476f063277b9	APPROVED

It bothers me a lot that many doctors tell women it is fine to skip the sugar pills and just take the hormonal pills back to back to skip periods. Yes I know the sugar pills are medically unnecessary and were simply included to mimic natural cycles. But there has also been little to no research on the side effects of taking the pill continuously. These pills can have some pretty serious side effects and the doctor is basically telling women to take a 25% higher dose than intended, often with absolutely no extra physical checkup or follow up. There have been no long term high population studies on women who take the pill as intended vs skipping the sugar pill. I think women are dosing themselves into all kinds of future trouble with many kinds of BC.	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609083ae5b31ab7f1c9b9f4a	00016b18b2--609083ae5b31ab7f1c9b9f4a	APPROVED

"The meme absolutely only functions because of sexism, but it's also an interesting phenomenon to think about intersectional concerns. There's a legitimate critique to made about how Middle-class white women largely abet other forms of oppression, and the term is often used by oppressed people to punch upwards. Really interesting in this article, I think, is the discussion of class.  The author suggests that in the UK ""Karen"" is working class, but that's distinctly not the impression I get in the US, where it really feels derisive of a certain form of middle-class privilege."	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609083ae5b31ab7f1c9b9f4a	00016b18b2--609083ae5b31ab7f1c9b9f4a	APPROVED

Being there and consistently stepping up in the hardest of times. I’m a very independent person and don’t require a lot of daily support or general emotional labor.

I completely agree with @BrendaChi when it comes to getting to know your body. Most importantly, I think if you want to get past the vaginas negative connotation, speak to your gynecologist about the purpose and complexity of it. Vaginas, while its visual appearance may be off-putting at first, are incredibly complex and amazing. As a woman it's so important to know that part of your body, not because of it's purpose but because of our own empowerment. Orgasms and masturbation can be empowering, too, but only do what you're comfortable with. The V Book by Dr. Elizabeth Stewart could be a good start for you. I haven't read it myself but my mother told me it's very powerful when it comes to learning about the vagina and seeing it for its power, not its stigma.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609083ee4a2a15762236c227	00016b18b2--609083ee4a2a15762236c227	APPROVED

"It would be great if there was a way to destigmatise being an ""angry feminist"". In a world rampant with sexual assault, anger is a natural response. People try to trivialise this anger by making it seem like being a feminist is a misguided pursuit. All of that being said, it doesn't answer your question at all. I don't really know. I feel I've been able to make progress with people in my life on these kinds of issues by just talking to them about it and by trying to gently guide them to another perspective on the issue. Its easy for me to say as I'm a man and as such I only experience this stuff laterally.

one of the things i think is really important to understand about recovering from sexual trauma is that your feelings are always going to be different, and *thats okay.*sometimes i feel like ripping his throat out and making him listen to me have a panic attack just so he can understand how awful he is. other times i feel like it’s all my fault. sometimes i want to tell the whole world what a terrible person he is. other times i want to curl up in a ball and just cry. sometimes i want to take a shower and scrub my skin until it’s on fire to get him off of me even though it’s been over a year. other times i want to go have meaningless sex, just to prove that i’m in control.and you know what? thats all fine. i dont have to have the same feelings about him every time i think about it. he’s already controlled that much of my life, and i’m not only allowed to have complicated emotions over it, it’s expected that i do. because what happened was a complicated thing, and my feelings can change.	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609083ee4a2a15762236c227	00016b18b2--609083ee4a2a15762236c227	APPROVED

It’s up to all of us, right here and right now, to demand better. The form that demand takes is going to vary from individual to individual, but we absolutely owe it to ourselves and every woman who came before us that we don’t let go of the freedoms they fought for.

I don’t have children but I do have a sister with children, and she has been experiencing exactly what you’re experiencing. She has 4 boys (ranging from 3 to 10) and a full time job. She and my brother-in-law have both been working from home during lockdown but it’s my sister who has had to juggle work, childcare/entertainment, housework and cooking meals. Every time she asks my brother-in-law to watch his own children so she can go on a call, he argues that he’s about to go on a work call too or has an important email to write, as if his work is intrinsically more important than hers. He’s even complained more than once that dinner is late.... she’s told me if it wasn’t for Covid, she’d have kicked him out by now. I feel for both you and her.

I can't speak of every family in Japan, but can speak of the families I've seen. Here in Japan, in many households, a father is still the most dominant role in a family, whereas his wife and children are just dismissed as the members of his household. Very little individuality is given to them. A father doesn't nurture, but control us. Not a few men are cruel and sadistic, but they need to cover those traits in order to blind victims and achieve their goal (power, control, exploitation and whatever), so patriarchy is a cunningly-made structure to satisfy such a male covert narcissist's ambition for prestige, position and power through his using the cover of serving his family and ministering to the NEEDS of his wife and children (the weak), when actually the needs are created by patriarchy (such as... many rapists are at large, so wives can't walk alone on streets late at night, and they need a ride from their hubbies; the male-dominant media nurtures/encourages pedophiles, and children need protection). This guard/guardian role of a father gives him a fertile ground for his covert aggression. He is underhanded, so doesn't beat or hit his subordinates (wife and children), but damn makes sure we have less faith in ourselves, feel less confident, and inferior to him, through everyday covert put-downs and countless enforced standards.	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--60908465d2eb476f06327f00	00016b18b2--60908465d2eb476f06327f00	APPROVED

"Edit: Those looking for a kindred spirit in attacking feminism, look elsewhere, I consider myself a feminist and support it's ideals and goals, I am here to address something personal, not any kind of anti-feminism rhetoric, feminist seem to have trouble hearing stories like mine out of personal pain they have experienced from men and nonsense right-wingers try to post here, anti-feminists 98% of the time have trouble hearing feminist voices out of fear and hate. I am not one of you, don't message me.This is very difficult for me to discuss.I am a cis straight male, I was raised from the ages of 4 - 15 by a progressive feminist lesbian in central Indiana.She is the source of a lot of my progressive values, such as being pro-choice, secular, enviotmentalist, pro-animal rights, a supporter of the LBGTQA community, and feminism itself.I had attended many gay pride parades before my 12th birthday and I would volunteer at the AIDS hospice my mother worked at.I never, and still do not, felt any shame for being from a homosexual family. I wasn't educated that the world outside our home was not as liberal, especially after we moved away from Indianapolis, as my household was. Therefore I was unprepared for the instant isolation that came about when I revealed to my peers in the small central Indiana school that I had two mothers. It did not go well, I instantly became the target for homophobic bullies, including the closest thing I had to a best friend. I attempted to make new friends, but the stigma of being the kid with the lesbo parents stuck, till the only person who would still talk to me was the kid with the locker next to mine, I eventually stopped talking to any if my peers at that school after that kid showed everyone else the invitation to my 12th birthday party I had put in his locker (I was given over 30 and I only have out one), he and the rest were laughing at how ""funny"" it was that I would actually believe that anyone would accept such an invitation. Things got better when we moved to an even smaller town, but this time, armed with my past social disasters, I kept my home life secret, I even made friends and had a girl ask me out (though I was so surprised by this that I said no before I understood what she had said), even the bullies at the school liked me. Then the house we lived in was condemned due to very dangerous wiring and we moved again (I attended 21 different schools before I was 18), the bad thing was that we moved to the same school district I attended before.This was the death blow to my social life. I completely shut down, I never made another friend or girlfriend and became terrified of my peers, by the time we had moved once again, I no longer had any social skills, I did not know how to make friends, this was severely compounded by another big struggle of my youth.The progressive feminist lesbian parent that had shaped the very core of my value system and made me so liberal, was a severe misandrist.I know this is a horrid stereotype that is thrown out by misogynists, homophobes, and other far-right bigots, but she honestly was a very prejudiced woman, she had her reasons for being this way, she suffered horrific abuses by men in HER youth (I will not tell those stories, sorry, they are her trauma and it is not my place to share them).She would constantly insult all men, even gay ones, in the house, throughout my childhood. If she saw an attractive woman walking with a man, it would disgust her and she would rant about it at length. She took me and my sister out of our school (my sister was 8) because she firmly believed that my sister would be gang-raped by her classmates if she kept us in public schools (she quickly gave up teaching us and we went back to public school after yet another move).As I grew up she started directing her hate towards me. She would call me over to inform me that she and my mother were never going to break up, despite the fact that I had never said anything to the contrary, I loved her and didn't want any seperation, but she felt that I must have secretly wished this because I was turning into a man.She always treated my sister better, she forgave her mistakes and came down harsh on mine. I spent most of the time from 10 - 14 grounded, and even when I had friends, I was forbidden from staying at their house or inviting them over.She would still insult other people of my gender and sexual orientation, not caring about how this would affect me as the only male in the house. She would tell me that I was destined to be a horrible person because I was going to grow up to be a man, and once it became clear that I was straight, the insults and dark predictions got worse.She hated my father and would always fight against my mother to stop us from seeing him. She would often hit me, she threw things at me in anger, ince throwing a hard back book at me so hard that it dropped me to the ground and left a bruise that lasted for over a month on my left thigh, she treated me like I was born a sex offender, this made puberty even harder than it already was with how socially isolated I was.This crippled my self-esteem, depression controlled my life for over a decade before I started to understand the source of my mental health problems and work to combat them.I despised my gender, I could never talk to any girl or woman I was interested in because I believed that I was so far beneath them that nothing I could offer could ever be good enough for any woman to overlook the evil that was my gender. My sexuality was also a source of shame, I believed that it was wrong for women to be with men, putting another hurdle in my path to a romantic relationship.This woman is the source for both my highly progressive ideals and the suffocating self-loathing that still plagues my life.I have no friends, no partner either. The internet has helped me out alot in expanding my social life, I have discovered interests like anime and I am active in their online communities.However I still suffer from all the insecurities the hate I was raised with. As I write this I am both terrified and deeply depressed, I wasn't even going to write this tonight because the torment was overwhelming me.Now I do know the point of this subreddit, I do has something I want to ask.I have often searched for any advice on how to overcome the pains of my childhood, but I never make it far.There are two types of discussions regarding misandrists common online.Men calling all feminists radical ""Feminazis"", call same sex parents unfit, homosexuality is a sin, and all the various disgusting vomit everyone on this subreddit are already very familiar with.Then there is the other side, the side that is supposed to support victims of gender shaming, but they don't, look up misandry and the vast majority of results will be feminists arguing that men cannot be victims of gender oppression. Articles declaring that calling misandry hate speech is dangerous and that it will lead to a massive outbreak in violence against women. That acts of hate should be punished differently based on the gender of the victim.Some even say that hate crimes should not extend to acts against men.These are the top results, go to stories of men such as me that are victims of misandry and you will often see multiple angry responses from feminists that accuse the man of being the real bigot, that he should have thought of HER pain, that the very idea of men being the victim of sexism was laughable, that somehow the abusive woman could always be justified in any so called ""abuse"" she gave.I have attempted suicide.I have hurt myself due the still present depression, I go to therapy to help. When I see such views being so common and mostly unopposed by the feminist movement, it is VERY painful. It seems to confirm the hate I and many other men suffered from.Abuse that many boys today suffer from around the world.I can garuntee you all one thing, that if I had read any of these discussions when I was younger, my suicide attempt would have succeeded. They would have been the final plunge into despair and I don't see me having the strength to keep living.Now, there are men and boys out there today suffering far worse than what I experienced, boys like I was, scared to reach out, lacking any real support, boys that get pulled into the hate-groups of the far and alt-right after reading and hearing hate unabashedly spread about a trait they had no choice in.So here is what I want to ask feminists.If I nearly (very very nearly) took my own life out of feeling I was born evil, what do you imagine some boy that has suffered turmoil I can't fathom encounters these discussions? Especially if he is a progressive like myself, some one that supports feminism, equal pay, is pro-choice, and despises bigotry, traits that mean the only support for our emotional abuse mostly denies that abuse such as our can exist or even worse, attack us and perpetuate the feeling of self loathing instilled on us by our abusers, even going so far as to say they we MUST be the abusers, that are abuser was justified in what they did, that we just misunderstood.2nd question:Do you think that feminists need to work on recognizing misandry and being more welcome to those that seek aid after suffering as a result of it?I know it is hard. I know that the hate comes from men depressingly often.That the hate is far more prevalent on the other side and the fight to defeat the patriarchy is still very much needed.I know that victim mentality is EVERYWHERE among those, such as myself, with privledged positions in western society, but denying the very existence of male victims and trying to say that misandry can be justified is literally killing people. I garuntee that a boy or man has come here and other places like this seeking support and what they found led to them taking their own life. It almost happened to me.Please help me and others like me, progressives are supposed to be the better people, if we are who we say we are, then we should not be afraid to recognize our own failings and we should always work to end their influence.When a man comes forward and he believes himself to be a victim, do not assume that he lack understanding of victimhood. When a feminist denies the existence of misandry, we need to stop ignoring it.We are incredulous when we see the right deny misogyny, enforced gender roles, rape culture, other forms of gender inequality, racial injustice, religious intolerance, and all the various fucked up stances of the conservatives among us.They are blind to the extent hatred has infected their world, they declare the #MeToo movement as overblown, or believing Black Lives Matter to be the same as the Klu Klux Klan.Our side suffers from similar blindness of our own evils, it is far stronger than many of us are aware and ignoring it is literally killing people.This, writing this was very painful and I cannot avoid feeling dread of receiving a level of hate I can't cope with, but I truly feel this needs to be discussed, both for the unfortunate victims, and those among us that are blind to the pain and hate they are feeding.I hope you see me as a comrade in arms and not an enemy soldier, and understand that I tried very hard to not speak ignorance here, and can forgive me for anything I was wrong about.It is my sincerest desire that all of your days are as full of meaning and happiness as is possible and you have my deepest gratitude for reading my thoughts For ease I have repeated my queries below:1st question:If I nearly (very very nearly) took my own life out of feeling I was born evil, what do you imagine some boy that has suffered turmoil I can't fathom is both shunned from conservative society and vilified by progressive society?2nd question:Do you think that feminists need to work on recognizing misandry and being more welcome to those that seek aid after suffering pain as a result of it?"	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--60908465d2eb476f06327f00	00016b18b2--60908465d2eb476f06327f00	APPROVED

I completely agree with @BrendaChi when it comes to getting to know your body. Most importantly, I think if you want to get past the vaginas negative connotation, speak to your gynecologist about the purpose and complexity of it. Vaginas, while its visual appearance may be off-putting at first, are incredibly complex and amazing. As a woman it's so important to know that part of your body, not because of it's purpose but because of our own empowerment. Orgasms and masturbation can be empowering, too, but only do what you're comfortable with. The V Book by Dr. Elizabeth Stewart could be a good start for you. I haven't read it myself but my mother told me it's very powerful when it comes to learning about the vagina and seeing it for its power, not its stigma.	1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609084990f15e875b1539d03	00016b18b2--609084990f15e875b1539d03	APPROVED

"It would be great if there was a way to destigmatise being an ""angry feminist"". In a world rampant with sexual assault, anger is a natural response. People try to trivialise this anger by making it seem like being a feminist is a misguided pursuit. All of that being said, it doesn't answer your question at all. I don't really know. I feel I've been able to make progress with people in my life on these kinds of issues by just talking to them about it and by trying to gently guide them to another perspective on the issue. Its easy for me to say as I'm a man and as such I only experience this stuff laterally.

one of the things i think is really important to understand about recovering from sexual trauma is that your feelings are always going to be different, and *thats okay.*sometimes i feel like ripping his throat out and making him listen to me have a panic attack just so he can understand how awful he is. other times i feel like it’s all my fault. sometimes i want to tell the whole world what a terrible person he is. other times i want to curl up in a ball and just cry. sometimes i want to take a shower and scrub my skin until it’s on fire to get him off of me even though it’s been over a year. other times i want to go have meaningless sex, just to prove that i’m in control.and you know what? thats all fine. i dont have to have the same feelings about him every time i think about it. he’s already controlled that much of my life, and i’m not only allowed to have complicated emotions over it, it’s expected that i do. because what happened was a complicated thing, and my feelings can change.	1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609084990f15e875b1539d03	00016b18b2--609084990f15e875b1539d03	APPROVED

I feel like the girl on the left could be compared to women in romance novels who get dumped in college once and then have “walls around my heart” and make a big goddamn deal of “will this arrogant jock - gasp - steal my heart?”I get that I’m probably missing the “pain isn’t a competition” point, but it kinda gets annoying when some people assume that girls’ problems are all because of guys’ heartbreaking actions.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--6090849d70a1e819bcbb6863	00016b18b2--6090849d70a1e819bcbb6863	APPROVED

"If they say not all men, and turn around to victim blame women it pretty much paints men as immature sex trolls. I'm a sex troll myself, but if i see a women or man wearing a bikini in a store, using their ass to hold groceries I'm going to ask first. I'll never assume consent until i know that persons interests, even then it's going to have to be clear. If they say men can't handle that, they basically defeat their own argument without you having to saying much.

My kind of question! I think the most satisfying thing to grow in your garden is cabbage and cauliflower. It’s so fun to watch them become these awesome beasts!

Strawberries are obviously adorable (those little white flowers - are you kidding?) Bleeding hearts and mexican sunflowers always make me happy.

"A lot of people are trying ""but what about trans people?"".Well, gender confirmation/reassignment surgery is a reconstruction procedure. Not cosmetic procedure.

I can't speak of every family in Japan, but can speak of the families I've seen. Here in Japan, in many households, a father is still the most dominant role in a family, whereas his wife and children are just dismissed as the members of his household. Very little individuality is given to them. A father doesn't nurture, but control us. Not a few men are cruel and sadistic, but they need to cover those traits in order to blind victims and achieve their goal (power, control, exploitation and whatever), so patriarchy is a cunningly-made structure to satisfy such a male covert narcissist's ambition for prestige, position and power through his using the cover of serving his family and ministering to the NEEDS of his wife and children (the weak), when actually the needs are created by patriarchy (such as... many rapists are at large, so wives can't walk alone on streets late at night, and they need a ride from their hubbies; the male-dominant media nurtures/encourages pedophiles, and children need protection). This guard/guardian role of a father gives him a fertile ground for his covert aggression. He is underhanded, so doesn't beat or hit his subordinates (wife and children), but damn makes sure we have less faith in ourselves, feel less confident, and inferior to him, through everyday covert put-downs and countless enforced standards.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609085bdf941c07be7bacadd	00016b18b2--609085bdf941c07be7bacadd	APPROVED

"Edit: Those looking for a kindred spirit in attacking feminism, look elsewhere, I consider myself a feminist and support it's ideals and goals, I am here to address something personal, not any kind of anti-feminism rhetoric, feminist seem to have trouble hearing stories like mine out of personal pain they have experienced from men and nonsense right-wingers try to post here, anti-feminists 98% of the time have trouble hearing feminist voices out of fear and hate. I am not one of you, don't message me.This is very difficult for me to discuss.I am a cis straight male, I was raised from the ages of 4 - 15 by a progressive feminist lesbian in central Indiana.She is the source of a lot of my progressive values, such as being pro-choice, secular, enviotmentalist, pro-animal rights, a supporter of the LBGTQA community, and feminism itself.I had attended many gay pride parades before my 12th birthday and I would volunteer at the AIDS hospice my mother worked at.I never, and still do not, felt any shame for being from a homosexual family. I wasn't educated that the world outside our home was not as liberal, especially after we moved away from Indianapolis, as my household was. Therefore I was unprepared for the instant isolation that came about when I revealed to my peers in the small central Indiana school that I had two mothers. It did not go well, I instantly became the target for homophobic bullies, including the closest thing I had to a best friend. I attempted to make new friends, but the stigma of being the kid with the lesbo parents stuck, till the only person who would still talk to me was the kid with the locker next to mine, I eventually stopped talking to any if my peers at that school after that kid showed everyone else the invitation to my 12th birthday party I had put in his locker (I was given over 30 and I only have out one), he and the rest were laughing at how ""funny"" it was that I would actually believe that anyone would accept such an invitation. Things got better when we moved to an even smaller town, but this time, armed with my past social disasters, I kept my home life secret, I even made friends and had a girl ask me out (though I was so surprised by this that I said no before I understood what she had said), even the bullies at the school liked me. Then the house we lived in was condemned due to very dangerous wiring and we moved again (I attended 21 different schools before I was 18), the bad thing was that we moved to the same school district I attended before.This was the death blow to my social life. I completely shut down, I never made another friend or girlfriend and became terrified of my peers, by the time we had moved once again, I no longer had any social skills, I did not know how to make friends, this was severely compounded by another big struggle of my youth.The progressive feminist lesbian parent that had shaped the very core of my value system and made me so liberal, was a severe misandrist.I know this is a horrid stereotype that is thrown out by misogynists, homophobes, and other far-right bigots, but she honestly was a very prejudiced woman, she had her reasons for being this way, she suffered horrific abuses by men in HER youth (I will not tell those stories, sorry, they are her trauma and it is not my place to share them).She would constantly insult all men, even gay ones, in the house, throughout my childhood. If she saw an attractive woman walking with a man, it would disgust her and she would rant about it at length. She took me and my sister out of our school (my sister was 8) because she firmly believed that my sister would be gang-raped by her classmates if she kept us in public schools (she quickly gave up teaching us and we went back to public school after yet another move).As I grew up she started directing her hate towards me. She would call me over to inform me that she and my mother were never going to break up, despite the fact that I had never said anything to the contrary, I loved her and didn't want any seperation, but she felt that I must have secretly wished this because I was turning into a man.She always treated my sister better, she forgave her mistakes and came down harsh on mine. I spent most of the time from 10 - 14 grounded, and even when I had friends, I was forbidden from staying at their house or inviting them over.She would still insult other people of my gender and sexual orientation, not caring about how this would affect me as the only male in the house. She would tell me that I was destined to be a horrible person because I was going to grow up to be a man, and once it became clear that I was straight, the insults and dark predictions got worse.She hated my father and would always fight against my mother to stop us from seeing him. She would often hit me, she threw things at me in anger, ince throwing a hard back book at me so hard that it dropped me to the ground and left a bruise that lasted for over a month on my left thigh, she treated me like I was born a sex offender, this made puberty even harder than it already was with how socially isolated I was.This crippled my self-esteem, depression controlled my life for over a decade before I started to understand the source of my mental health problems and work to combat them.I despised my gender, I could never talk to any girl or woman I was interested in because I believed that I was so far beneath them that nothing I could offer could ever be good enough for any woman to overlook the evil that was my gender. My sexuality was also a source of shame, I believed that it was wrong for women to be with men, putting another hurdle in my path to a romantic relationship.This woman is the source for both my highly progressive ideals and the suffocating self-loathing that still plagues my life.I have no friends, no partner either. The internet has helped me out alot in expanding my social life, I have discovered interests like anime and I am active in their online communities.However I still suffer from all the insecurities the hate I was raised with. As I write this I am both terrified and deeply depressed, I wasn't even going to write this tonight because the torment was overwhelming me.Now I do know the point of this subreddit, I do has something I want to ask.I have often searched for any advice on how to overcome the pains of my childhood, but I never make it far.There are two types of discussions regarding misandrists common online.Men calling all feminists radical ""Feminazis"", call same sex parents unfit, homosexuality is a sin, and all the various disgusting vomit everyone on this subreddit are already very familiar with.Then there is the other side, the side that is supposed to support victims of gender shaming, but they don't, look up misandry and the vast majority of results will be feminists arguing that men cannot be victims of gender oppression. Articles declaring that calling misandry hate speech is dangerous and that it will lead to a massive outbreak in violence against women. That acts of hate should be punished differently based on the gender of the victim.Some even say that hate crimes should not extend to acts against men.These are the top results, go to stories of men such as me that are victims of misandry and you will often see multiple angry responses from feminists that accuse the man of being the real bigot, that he should have thought of HER pain, that the very idea of men being the victim of sexism was laughable, that somehow the abusive woman could always be justified in any so called ""abuse"" she gave.I have attempted suicide.I have hurt myself due the still present depression, I go to therapy to help. When I see such views being so common and mostly unopposed by the feminist movement, it is VERY painful. It seems to confirm the hate I and many other men suffered from.Abuse that many boys today suffer from around the world.I can garuntee you all one thing, that if I had read any of these discussions when I was younger, my suicide attempt would have succeeded. They would have been the final plunge into despair and I don't see me having the strength to keep living.Now, there are men and boys out there today suffering far worse than what I experienced, boys like I was, scared to reach out, lacking any real support, boys that get pulled into the hate-groups of the far and alt-right after reading and hearing hate unabashedly spread about a trait they had no choice in.So here is what I want to ask feminists.If I nearly (very very nearly) took my own life out of feeling I was born evil, what do you imagine some boy that has suffered turmoil I can't fathom encounters these discussions? Especially if he is a progressive like myself, some one that supports feminism, equal pay, is pro-choice, and despises bigotry, traits that mean the only support for our emotional abuse mostly denies that abuse such as our can exist or even worse, attack us and perpetuate the feeling of self loathing instilled on us by our abusers, even going so far as to say they we MUST be the abusers, that are abuser was justified in what they did, that we just misunderstood.2nd question:Do you think that feminists need to work on recognizing misandry and being more welcome to those that seek aid after suffering as a result of it?I know it is hard. I know that the hate comes from men depressingly often.That the hate is far more prevalent on the other side and the fight to defeat the patriarchy is still very much needed.I know that victim mentality is EVERYWHERE among those, such as myself, with privledged positions in western society, but denying the very existence of male victims and trying to say that misandry can be justified is literally killing people. I garuntee that a boy or man has come here and other places like this seeking support and what they found led to them taking their own life. It almost happened to me.Please help me and others like me, progressives are supposed to be the better people, if we are who we say we are, then we should not be afraid to recognize our own failings and we should always work to end their influence.When a man comes forward and he believes himself to be a victim, do not assume that he lack understanding of victimhood. When a feminist denies the existence of misandry, we need to stop ignoring it.We are incredulous when we see the right deny misogyny, enforced gender roles, rape culture, other forms of gender inequality, racial injustice, religious intolerance, and all the various fucked up stances of the conservatives among us.They are blind to the extent hatred has infected their world, they declare the #MeToo movement as overblown, or believing Black Lives Matter to be the same as the Klu Klux Klan.Our side suffers from similar blindness of our own evils, it is far stronger than many of us are aware and ignoring it is literally killing people.This, writing this was very painful and I cannot avoid feeling dread of receiving a level of hate I can't cope with, but I truly feel this needs to be discussed, both for the unfortunate victims, and those among us that are blind to the pain and hate they are feeding.I hope you see me as a comrade in arms and not an enemy soldier, and understand that I tried very hard to not speak ignorance here, and can forgive me for anything I was wrong about.It is my sincerest desire that all of your days are as full of meaning and happiness as is possible and you have my deepest gratitude for reading my thoughts For ease I have repeated my queries below:1st question:If I nearly (very very nearly) took my own life out of feeling I was born evil, what do you imagine some boy that has suffered turmoil I can't fathom is both shunned from conservative society and vilified by progressive society?2nd question:Do you think that feminists need to work on recognizing misandry and being more welcome to those that seek aid after suffering pain as a result of it?"	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609085bdf941c07be7bacadd	00016b18b2--609085bdf941c07be7bacadd	APPROVED

My kind of question! I think the most satisfying thing to grow in your garden is cabbage and cauliflower. It’s so fun to watch them become these awesome beasts! I think it’s great to have the basics, tomatoes, lettuce, potatoes, peas, basil, etc. I love nasturtiums, they’re beautiful little flowers that make salads (and any dish) just a little extra gorgeous! Strawberries are obviously adorable (those little white flowers - are you kidding?) Bleeding hearts and mexican sunflowers always make me happy.

"It is tiring, and it's ok to take a break sometimes. Just go do your own hobbies and try not to focus on the shit things going on around the world.Also, I find that there's no use debating people who are arguing in bad faith. Usually people who complain about ""men's issues"" in response to someone talking about women's issues don't actually care about either. If they did, they'd probably just google it and see very fast that feminism *will* help men - not that this should matter imo, I think elevating women's suffering should be enough for it to be a worthwhile cause. Not everything has to benifit men. Women don't complain when they see prostate cancer research being done, because they didn't grow up with the idea that everything has to be for them.I get tired too, and it's hard to tell who's arguing in bad faith and who actually wants to be educated.

I'm really looking forward to reading bell hooks but this analysis troubles me. Advocating for a specific demographic will automatically oppress other demographics? Aiming to have the same privilege as the high status demographic means I must take others' privilege away? Seems so 'zero-sum' and absolutist.Maybe I'm reading this the wrong way, but I don't agree with these blanket statements. I can work on fighting sexism and racism at the same time just like I can walk and chew gum. Raising awareness of my lack of privilege doesn't require me to harm others. What an odd notion.

"Hello! I've been working at my first job for a few months now. It has been wonderful, everyone I met try their best to be inclusive, and the company truly cares about diversity and equal opportunities and it shows.Except... I've started to notice that a colleague (Guy A) that works very closely to me (and also considered by me a not-so-close 'friend') tends to say discriminating things very subtly.I've had someone say something quite rude to me when I started work, and at that time I couldn't control my emotions (read: tears) so I just left the room. I'm in good terms with that person but this Guy A has been telling other people that he's scared to ask me for help because I'll react that way.If I look at myself objectively, I used to be hot headed sometimes, but gosh, I've never shouted, snapped, made a rude/snarky comment to anyone in the co. If anything I thought I adore the people I work with so I was always careful with how I react. If I feel like crying, I'll just walk out saying I'm unwell or something, although that never even happened twice.I try not to be too close to this guy despite us sharing mutual friends because of the kind of rude remarks he makes. He once got upset that someone said something 'feminist' during a large event (context - someone said thank you for including female characters in an exercise we were doing...). He downright asked me if I had plastic surgery (first person to ask me that). He told me my job and my role is not very core to the team while he's is. He believes in the 'girls bringing girls down' narrative and subtly tries to pit girls against each other by comparing their looks. He asks me ""how much did you buy *something ""fancy"" like a Starbucks drink*"" with a judgemental tone.But I've been noticing a more disturbing thing he's doing recently which is framing women around her who show emotions (negative ones especially) or speak up assertively as ""scary"" and hard to approach. I've also noticed that he likes girls who are super nice and smiley as friends and judges girls who may not smile all the time or express their preferences.Do I want to be his friend? I can pass. Do I want to confront him? Hard pass. But we have so many mutual friends and it's such a tightly knit community that I can't avoid him forever. Oh, and we work together. What surprises me the most is that I brushed off most of these red flags so far and actually thought that he was a good friend, a good 'bro' material.How do I deal with these kind of people?"	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609086947a614251c970a32b	00016b18b2--609086947a614251c970a32b	APPROVED

I completely agree with @BrendaChi when it comes to getting to know your body. Most importantly, I think if you want to get past the vaginas negative connotation, speak to your gynecologist about the purpose and complexity of it. Vaginas, while its visual appearance may be off-putting at first, are incredibly complex and amazing. As a woman it's so important to know that part of your body, not because of it's purpose but because of our own empowerment. Orgasms and masturbation can be empowering, too, but only do what you're comfortable with. The V Book by Dr. Elizabeth Stewart could be a good start for you. I haven't read it myself but my mother told me it's very powerful when it comes to learning about the vagina and seeing it for its power, not its stigma.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609086e49fe36f17d7cda75e	00016b18b2--609086e49fe36f17d7cda75e	APPROVED

"It would be great if there was a way to destigmatise being an ""angry feminist"". In a world rampant with sexual assault, anger is a natural response. People try to trivialise this anger by making it seem like being a feminist is a misguided pursuit. All of that being said, it doesn't answer your question at all. I don't really know. I feel I've been able to make progress with people in my life on these kinds of issues by just talking to them about it and by trying to gently guide them to another perspective on the issue.

one of the things i think is really important to understand about recovering from sexual trauma is that your feelings are always going to be different, and *thats okay.*sometimes i feel like ripping his throat out and making him listen to me have a panic attack just so he can understand how awful he is. other times i feel like it’s all my fault. sometimes i want to tell the whole world what a terrible person he is. other times i want to curl up in a ball and just cry. sometimes i want to take a shower and scrub my skin until it’s on fire to get him off of me even though it’s been over a year. other times i want to go have meaningless sex, just to prove that i’m in control.and you know what? thats all fine. i dont have to have the same feelings about him every time i think about it. he’s already controlled that much of my life, and i’m not only allowed to have complicated emotions over it, it’s expected that i do. because what happened was a complicated thing, and my feelings can change.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609086e49fe36f17d7cda75e	00016b18b2--609086e49fe36f17d7cda75e	APPROVED

I can't speak of every family in Japan, but can speak of the families I've seen. Here in Japan, in many households, a father is still the most dominant role in a family, whereas his wife and children are just dismissed as the members of his household. Very little individuality is given to them. A father doesn't nurture, but control us. Not a few men are cruel and sadistic, but they need to cover those traits in order to blind victims and achieve their goal (power, control, exploitation and whatever), so patriarchy is a cunningly-made structure to satisfy such a male covert narcissist's ambition for prestige, position and power through his using the cover of serving his family and ministering to the NEEDS of his wife and children (the weak), when actually the needs are created by patriarchy (such as... many rapists are at large, so wives can't walk alone on streets late at night, and they need a ride from their hubbies; the male-dominant media nurtures/encourages pedophiles, and children need protection). This guard/guardian role of a father gives him a fertile ground for his covert aggression. He is underhanded, so doesn't beat or hit his subordinates (wife and children), but damn makes sure we have less faith in ourselves, feel less confident, and inferior to him, through everyday covert put-downs and countless enforced standards.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--6090872cd2eb476f0632964d	00016b18b2--6090872cd2eb476f0632964d	APPROVED

"Edit: Those looking for a kindred spirit in attacking feminism, look elsewhere, I consider myself a feminist and support it's ideals and goals, I am here to address something personal, not any kind of anti-feminism rhetoric, feminist seem to have trouble hearing stories like mine out of personal pain they have experienced from men and nonsense right-wingers try to post here, anti-feminists 98% of the time have trouble hearing feminist voices out of fear and hate. I am not one of you, don't message me.This is very difficult for me to discuss.I am a cis straight male, I was raised from the ages of 4 - 15 by a progressive feminist lesbian in central Indiana.She is the source of a lot of my progressive values, such as being pro-choice, secular, enviotmentalist, pro-animal rights, a supporter of the LBGTQA community, and feminism itself.I had attended many gay pride parades before my 12th birthday and I would volunteer at the AIDS hospice my mother worked at.I never, and still do not, felt any shame for being from a homosexual family. I wasn't educated that the world outside our home was not as liberal, especially after we moved away from Indianapolis, as my household was. Therefore I was unprepared for the instant isolation that came about when I revealed to my peers in the small central Indiana school that I had two mothers. It did not go well, I instantly became the target for homophobic bullies, including the closest thing I had to a best friend. I attempted to make new friends, but the stigma of being the kid with the lesbo parents stuck, till the only person who would still talk to me was the kid with the locker next to mine, I eventually stopped talking to any if my peers at that school after that kid showed everyone else the invitation to my 12th birthday party I had put in his locker (I was given over 30 and I only have out one), he and the rest were laughing at how ""funny"" it was that I would actually believe that anyone would accept such an invitation. Things got better when we moved to an even smaller town, but this time, armed with my past social disasters, I kept my home life secret, I even made friends and had a girl ask me out (though I was so surprised by this that I said no before I understood what she had said), even the bullies at the school liked me. Then the house we lived in was condemned due to very dangerous wiring and we moved again (I attended 21 different schools before I was 18), the bad thing was that we moved to the same school district I attended before.This was the death blow to my social life. I completely shut down, I never made another friend or girlfriend and became terrified of my peers, by the time we had moved once again, I no longer had any social skills, I did not know how to make friends, this was severely compounded by another big struggle of my youth.The progressive feminist lesbian parent that had shaped the very core of my value system and made me so liberal, was a severe misandrist.I know this is a horrid stereotype that is thrown out by misogynists, homophobes, and other far-right bigots, but she honestly was a very prejudiced woman, she had her reasons for being this way, she suffered horrific abuses by men in HER youth (I will not tell those stories, sorry, they are her trauma and it is not my place to share them).She would constantly insult all men, even gay ones, in the house, throughout my childhood. If she saw an attractive woman walking with a man, it would disgust her and she would rant about it at length. She took me and my sister out of our school (my sister was 8) because she firmly believed that my sister would be gang-raped by her classmates if she kept us in public schools (she quickly gave up teaching us and we went back to public school after yet another move).As I grew up she started directing her hate towards me. She would call me over to inform me that she and my mother were never going to break up, despite the fact that I had never said anything to the contrary, I loved her and didn't want any seperation, but she felt that I must have secretly wished this because I was turning into a man.She always treated my sister better, she forgave her mistakes and came down harsh on mine. I spent most of the time from 10 - 14 grounded, and even when I had friends, I was forbidden from staying at their house or inviting them over.She would still insult other people of my gender and sexual orientation, not caring about how this would affect me as the only male in the house. She would tell me that I was destined to be a horrible person because I was going to grow up to be a man, and once it became clear that I was straight, the insults and dark predictions got worse.She hated my father and would always fight against my mother to stop us from seeing him. She would often hit me, she threw things at me in anger, ince throwing a hard back book at me so hard that it dropped me to the ground and left a bruise that lasted for over a month on my left thigh, she treated me like I was born a sex offender, this made puberty even harder than it already was with how socially isolated I was.This crippled my self-esteem, depression controlled my life for over a decade before I started to understand the source of my mental health problems and work to combat them.I despised my gender, I could never talk to any girl or woman I was interested in because I believed that I was so far beneath them that nothing I could offer could ever be good enough for any woman to overlook the evil that was my gender. My sexuality was also a source of shame, I believed that it was wrong for women to be with men, putting another hurdle in my path to a romantic relationship.This woman is the source for both my highly progressive ideals and the suffocating self-loathing that still plagues my life.I have no friends, no partner either. The internet has helped me out alot in expanding my social life, I have discovered interests like anime and I am active in their online communities.However I still suffer from all the insecurities the hate I was raised with. As I write this I am both terrified and deeply depressed, I wasn't even going to write this tonight because the torment was overwhelming me.Now I do know the point of this subreddit, I do has something I want to ask.I have often searched for any advice on how to overcome the pains of my childhood, but I never make it far.There are two types of discussions regarding misandrists common online.Men calling all feminists radical ""Feminazis"", call same sex parents unfit, homosexuality is a sin, and all the various disgusting vomit everyone on this subreddit are already very familiar with.Then there is the other side, the side that is supposed to support victims of gender shaming, but they don't, look up misandry and the vast majority of results will be feminists arguing that men cannot be victims of gender oppression. Articles declaring that calling misandry hate speech is dangerous and that it will lead to a massive outbreak in violence against women. That acts of hate should be punished differently based on the gender of the victim.Some even say that hate crimes should not extend to acts against men.These are the top results, go to stories of men such as me that are victims of misandry and you will often see multiple angry responses from feminists that accuse the man of being the real bigot, that he should have thought of HER pain, that the very idea of men being the victim of sexism was laughable, that somehow the abusive woman could always be justified in any so called ""abuse"" she gave.I have attempted suicide.I have hurt myself due the still present depression, I go to therapy to help. When I see such views being so common and mostly unopposed by the feminist movement, it is VERY painful. It seems to confirm the hate I and many other men suffered from.Abuse that many boys today suffer from around the world.I can garuntee you all one thing, that if I had read any of these discussions when I was younger, my suicide attempt would have succeeded. They would have been the final plunge into despair and I don't see me having the strength to keep living.Now, there are men and boys out there today suffering far worse than what I experienced, boys like I was, scared to reach out, lacking any real support, boys that get pulled into the hate-groups of the far and alt-right after reading and hearing hate unabashedly spread about a trait they had no choice in.So here is what I want to ask feminists.If I nearly (very very nearly) took my own life out of feeling I was born evil, what do you imagine some boy that has suffered turmoil I can't fathom encounters these discussions? Especially if he is a progressive like myself, some one that supports feminism, equal pay, is pro-choice, and despises bigotry, traits that mean the only support for our emotional abuse mostly denies that abuse such as our can exist or even worse, attack us and perpetuate the feeling of self loathing instilled on us by our abusers, even going so far as to say they we MUST be the abusers, that are abuser was justified in what they did, that we just misunderstood.2nd question:Do you think that feminists need to work on recognizing misandry and being more welcome to those that seek aid after suffering as a result of it?I know it is hard. I know that the hate comes from men depressingly often.That the hate is far more prevalent on the other side and the fight to defeat the patriarchy is still very much needed.I know that victim mentality is EVERYWHERE among those, such as myself, with privledged positions in western society, but denying the very existence of male victims and trying to say that misandry can be justified is literally killing people. I garuntee that a boy or man has come here and other places like this seeking support and what they found led to them taking their own life. It almost happened to me.Please help me and others like me, progressives are supposed to be the better people, if we are who we say we are, then we should not be afraid to recognize our own failings and we should always work to end their influence.When a man comes forward and he believes himself to be a victim, do not assume that he lack understanding of victimhood. When a feminist denies the existence of misandry, we need to stop ignoring it.We are incredulous when we see the right deny misogyny, enforced gender roles, rape culture, other forms of gender inequality, racial injustice, religious intolerance, and all the various fucked up stances of the conservatives among us.They are blind to the extent hatred has infected their world, they declare the #MeToo movement as overblown, or believing Black Lives Matter to be the same as the Klu Klux Klan.Our side suffers from similar blindness of our own evils, it is far stronger than many of us are aware and ignoring it is literally killing people.This, writing this was very painful and I cannot avoid feeling dread of receiving a level of hate I can't cope with, but I truly feel this needs to be discussed, both for the unfortunate victims, and those among us that are blind to the pain and hate they are feeding.I hope you see me as a comrade in arms and not an enemy soldier, and understand that I tried very hard to not speak ignorance here, and can forgive me for anything I was wrong about.It is my sincerest desire that all of your days are as full of meaning and happiness as is possible and you have my deepest gratitude for reading my thoughts For ease I have repeated my queries below:1st question:If I nearly (very very nearly) took my own life out of feeling I was born evil, what do you imagine some boy that has suffered turmoil I can't fathom is both shunned from conservative society and vilified by progressive society?2nd question:Do you think that feminists need to work on recognizing misandry and being more welcome to those that seek aid after suffering pain as a result of it?"	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--6090872cd2eb476f0632964d	00016b18b2--6090872cd2eb476f0632964d	APPROVED

"(Self nude representation) I think it's a matter of personal opinionWith the female empowerment movement we see women being more open with their sexuality, sex work, nudes etc. It can be seen empowering as women are shamed for these things. By doing them instead of being afraid of being shamed. Women are essentially taking back the power of their bodies etc.*However*, there are ways it can be seen as there still being exploited.Women who share their nudes openly and willingly, or take part in porn (e.g. only fans) is pushed as being empowering. But ultimately, they're still just being sexualised by men. What women share will be used by men for sexual gratification. So is this not women still being sexually exploited but they're made to believe its empowering?The same can be applied to women being more open with casual sex. It is seen as empowering because they're taking control of their sexuality, they're defying the slut shaming and going out there and doing what they want.But then there is the orgasm gap between men and women, meaning when women hook up, they're likely to leave without ever having an orgasm, but he almost always finishes. So we say women hooking up is sexually empowering...but...they're not being pleased, only he is. So are women not just being exploited still, but we are just made to believe by society that it is something we want in the name of empowerment? *Conclusion* It all depends on your personal view of things.- women sharing nudes is sexually empowering because they're claiming back power.- women sharing nudes is sexually exploiting them still because those photos are going to be used for mens sexual gratification. Thus they are still being exploited by men, and are ""empowered"" to keep sharing all so men can be benefitted more easily."	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--6090872fd2eb476f06329658	00016b18b2--6090872fd2eb476f06329658	APPROVED

"It is tiring, and it's ok to take a break sometimes. Just go do your own hobbies and try not to focus on the shit things going on around the world.Also, I find that there's no use debating people who are arguing in bad faith. Usually people who complain about ""men's issues"" in response to someone talking about women's issues don't actually care about either. If they did, they'd probably just google it and see very fast that feminism *will* help men - not that this should matter imo, I think elevating women's suffering should be enough for it to be a worthwhile cause. Not everything has to benifit men. Women don't complain when they see prostate cancer research being done, because they didn't grow up with the idea that everything has to be for them.I get tired too, and it's hard to tell who's arguing in bad faith and who actually wants to be educated.

I'm really looking forward to reading bell hooks but this analysis troubles me. Advocating for a specific demographic will automatically oppress other demographics?

"Hello! I've been working at my first job for a few months now. It has been wonderful, everyone I met try their best to be inclusive, and the company truly cares about diversity and equal opportunities and it shows.Except... I've started to notice that a colleague (Guy A) that works very closely to me (and also considered by me a not-so-close 'friend') tends to say discriminating things very subtly.I've had someone say something quite rude to me when I started work, and at that time I couldn't control my emotions (read: tears) so I just left the room. I'm in good terms with that person but this Guy A has been telling other people that he's scared to ask me for help because I'll react that way.If I look at myself objectively, I used to be hot headed sometimes, but gosh, I've never shouted, snapped, made a rude/snarky comment to anyone in the co. If anything I thought I adore the people I work with so I was always careful with how I react. If I feel like crying, I'll just walk out saying I'm unwell or something, although that never even happened twice.I try not to be too close to this guy despite us sharing mutual friends because of the kind of rude remarks he makes. He once got upset that someone said something 'feminist' during a large event (context - someone said thank you for including female characters in an exercise we were doing...). He downright asked me if I had plastic surgery (first person to ask me that). He told me my job and my role is not very core to the team while he's is. He believes in the 'girls bringing girls down' narrative and subtly tries to pit girls against each other by comparing their looks. He asks me ""how much did you buy *something ""fancy"" like a Starbucks drink*"" with a judgemental tone.But I've been noticing a more disturbing thing he's doing recently which is framing women around her who show emotions (negative ones especially) or speak up assertively as ""scary"" and hard to approach. I've also noticed that he likes girls who are super nice and smiley as friends and judges girls who may not smile all the time or express their preferences.Do I want to be his friend? I can pass. Do I want to confront him? Hard pass. But we have so many mutual friends and it's such a tightly knit community that I can't avoid him forever. Oh, and we work together. What surprises me the most is that I brushed off most of these red flags so far and actually thought that he was a good friend, a good 'bro' material.How do I deal with these kind of people?"	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609087565549355605fb5b0a	00016b18b2--609087565549355605fb5b0a	APPROVED

The police took me to the hospital (I was 15) and brought me through the back to get checked out. I told them I didn’t want my parents to know. Just my luck, my dad was there for a nose bleed, they saw me in the hall. Did a rape kit, for some medication to prevent HIV, took plan B and then gave a statement to the police. It took over a year to go trial. Met with a victim service worker who wasn’t very helpful and with the crown attorney a few times. A private investigator followed me around a few times and tried to question me and people I knew about me to get dirt on me. I was bullied really badly in high school and got into drugs and drinking. Lost a lot of friends and my family split. In the end one guy was plead guilty and was given 3 years (only because he was 26 and had raped 10 other girls, most minors) and the other got off with nothing. He ended up walking around town with a knife trying to find me but the cops got him and I had a restraining order put against him. I regret coming forward personally but I can see how it would be positive for some people. For me it just dragged out the experience and caused a lot more problems. Unfortunately I was sexually assaulted again at 21 and I’ve never told anyone and never will.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--6090877c9d36706924e94f3e	00016b18b2--6090877c9d36706924e94f3e	APPROVED
All about context. I had an elderly Japanese lady complimenting my height and hair in a bathroom once.

I divorced him.  It was scary and difficult to make that choice, but it was THE best decision of my life.  In therapy I wanted to find out why I chose him to marry so I wouldn't repeat the mistake.  Among other things (like I married someone just like my father - ugh, so textbook), I discovered I had a 'puny ego' and had very little self-worth.  Ditched the husband and went searching for 'me'.  That was 34 years ago and my life has been way better than I ever imagined it could be.

Until a few weeks ago I didn’t know what male gaze was so when I encountered this term I looked it up and educated myself on male gaze in film.

Was driving home in a torrential downpour with tornado warnings on a Sunday. Had the kids in the car heading home. Drove by a local business that was closed and saw a young guy trying to take cover underneath the building overhang. He had his bicycle with him. He was just absolutely wrecked looking. I hurried home, got the kids out and into the house, ran in and grabbed an oversized PinkFloyd hoodie that I had, thinking it should fit him okay. I drove the few miles back down to where he was. Wheeled in and asked if he wanted help and a ride. He said yes and dropped his bike to jump in the car. He was freezing cold in a short sleeve shirt and shorts. Told him nah we’re going to take the bike too and we loaded it into the back of my vehicle. We both then jumped in, I gave him the hoodie to put on and I drove him home with his bike. Told him to keep the hoodie, he told me he didn’t think people like me really existed.In the amount of time it took me to go home, drop off my kids, get the vehicle ready to grab his bike quickly and the hoodie I can guarantee at least 50 cars must’ve gone by him. That’s awful. I was hoping he’d be gone when I got there; that someone else stopped to help.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--6090882dd2eb476f06329f36	00016b18b2--6090882dd2eb476f06329f36	APPROVED
Has reached the point of basic adulting (handsoap and hamdtowel in the bathroom, basic food staples in the kitchen). Not so exciting, but shows some pride in his home.

"I got this job right before the pandemic. I worked here 3 weeks before they furloughed 90% of the company.

My kind of question! I think the most satisfying thing to grow in your garden is cabbage and cauliflower. It’s so fun to watch them become these awesome beasts! I think it’s great to have the basics, tomatoes, lettuce, potatoes, peas, basil, etc. I love nasturtiums, they’re beautiful little flowers that make salads (and any dish) just a little extra gorgeous! Strawberries are obviously adorable (those little white flowers - are you kidding?) Bleeding hearts and mexican sunflowers always make me happy.

Was driving home in a torrential downpour with tornado warnings on a Sunday. Had the kids in the car heading home. Drove by a local business that was closed and saw a young guy trying to take cover underneath the building overhang. He had his bicycle with him. He was just absolutely wrecked looking. I hurried home, got the kids out and into the house, ran in and grabbed an oversized PinkFloyd hoodie that I had, thinking it should fit him okay. I drove the few miles back down to where he was. Wheeled in and asked if he wanted help and a ride. He said yes and dropped his bike to jump in the car. He was freezing cold in a short sleeve shirt and shorts. Told him nah we’re going to take the bike too and we loaded it into the back of my vehicle. We both then jumped in, I gave him the hoodie to put on and I drove him home with his bike. Told him to keep the hoodie, he told me he didn’t think people like me really existed.In the amount of time it took me to go home, drop off my kids, get the vehicle ready to grab his bike quickly and the hoodie I can guarantee at least 50 cars must’ve gone by him. That’s awful. I was hoping he’d be gone when I got there; that someone else stopped to help.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--6090892d9d36706924e95b19	00016b18b2--6090892d9d36706924e95b19	APPROVED
Has reached the point of basic adulting (handsoap and hamdtowel in the bathroom, basic food staples in the kitchen). Not so exciting, but shows some pride in his home.

He was so serious about me from the start - expressed interest in living together, getting married, etc. But when we had been together an extended time and then it was naturally time to take a next step, he kept making excuses. If he wasn't ready, that would have been fine, but instead he kept trying to place blame elsewhere.

I cut cold turkey with about several medications. (Dont lecture me I had a whole talking to from the doctors years ago lol) For the next couple of months I had involuntary eye movements. It would look like my eyes shake side to side or up and down. I couldn’t sleep or I would sleep too much. The insomnia and fatigue was my major block. My moods sometimes dipped or I was stagnant.

Well, a friend and I had gone to the ER. A Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (or a SANE) did a rape kit on me. I’m a forensic science student, we just finished our rape and sexual assault chapter, and I have to say it was pretty weird being able to describe what was happening, what chemicals she was swabbing on my skin, what reactions happen to determine if he had left body fluids on me. I don’t know why, then, I had gone home and showered and scrubbed the places he had touched me raw. I should’ve studied harder and remembered that was one of the reasons evidence is compromised. My forensics final exam was that day, actually. I got a seventy-five. About a month later, I reported it to the police. They had me write down what happened, the detective read my statement. He had me recount it verbally to him. He asked me questions and tried to catch me in a lie. The detective said he thought it was fishy that I couldn’t remember what time it happened, how many drinks I had, etc but I could remember the actual assault in extreme detail. I said well, yeah, I wish I didn’t remember it that detailed, I have flashbacks about it every day. Nothing happened. They called me a while later asking me to come in again, they accused me of cheating on my boyfriend because they found ‘another mans’ dna inside me (my bf) and not my assaulter’s. The detective asked if I had any contact with my assaulter since then, because I’d go through all of this for fun or something? They said it was my word against his. Nothing came of it at all	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--60908c3a7d9ddc487d52e149	00016b18b2--60908c3a7d9ddc487d52e149	APPROVED

This shit is so toxic. I was 19 when my husband and I got together. This stupid rhetoric was in my head. I remember storming out once during an argument, and I got super super upset that he didn’t follow or try to stop me. After we resolved things I told him I was sad that he didn’t.

Both of ma parents were alcoholics. Dad became a Christian and stopped drinking when I was 12 or 13. Mom, partly for spite and partly because it was the first time Dad went and did something without her permission, upped her drinking game to the bottomless wine goblet from the moment she came home until she went to bed. If she was annoyed about something at work, she took it out on the first person in her sights, usually me.  I started staying in my room to avoid her, or go out with friends to get out of the house. She was verbally abusive and even a straight A report card in school would draw criticism. We had an intervention with her, and she continued to drink. I would not let my children stay with her as I could not trust her with them.  Ironically, Dad, who did not drink for the last 35+ years of his life, died from cirrhosis, and Mom died from congestive heart failure.  Yes, this very much influenced my choice of people I dated. If you were drunk, I wouldn’t go out more than once. Even today, I limit my intake. My brother has repeated my parents habits and is an alcoholic, verbally abusive as well. After Dad died, I pretty much cut off all contact with him.	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--60908dcf6d35fb117b93056d	00016b18b2--60908dcf6d35fb117b93056d	APPROVED

When I was a young college student first getting out of my Christian fundamentalist upbringing bubble, I used to think that surely feminists, progressives, etc would be kind and good people because their beliefs (so I thought) stemmed from empathy toward others and wanting a better society. It was hard to learn that progressives can *also* be needlessly unkind, uncompassionate, spiteful, hateful, etc. Obviously not at the same rate or in the same way as bigoted racist alt righters, but it was a sad awakening. It was hard watching a professor of feminist theory who also liked to mock her own grad students in seminar until they almost cried.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--60908eca7a614251c971109d	00016b18b2--60908eca7a614251c971109d	APPROVED

"Hi im a 14 year old boy from spain and since 7th grade we've been really getting this kind of ""feminist education"" were even in schools there is like graffitis that encourage women to become what they want and all that and ive been basically seen since 7th grade that they dont really care about us, i remember for example that in 7th grade when we were doing a swimming course in a centre outside the school when we were changing after the swimming class there were 2 women who worked there watching us change our clothes just standing up there without doing anything besides watching  and nobody said anything to them and obviously if it would've been the other way around there would've been a  big outrage by teachers and the female students and basically asides from that we also had feminist talks with fake information like ""only 0.01% of the rape allegations are fake""  and also how when they were giving us sexual education classes basically they were just teaching about no is no and just talking to the girls that they could always like back down and when like men hit women ( i think its named gender violence or something) and then also i feel like girls pretend that theres sexism against them like when they once made a hole power point with ""sexist comments about them"" but basically nothing really had to do with their gender for example, one of their sexist comments they got was a joke a male student made because one of the girls got the highest grade in an exam but she couldnt figure out who to make the screen projector work so he said something like "" too smart to get the highest mark but not to make the screen work and they tried to make us think it was sexist but in my opinion that could've been said to a male student anyway, and many other stuff has happened and i dont really feel like they care about us males anymore, it feels like they honestly dont give a fuck about our mental health and all besides our marks to make the school look good.Thanks for reading i will try to answer to  your comments after i wake up (its late in spain) because i have to go to sleep because theres school tomorrow.

[Source](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/waterhouse-the-magic-circle-n01572)&nbsp;Miracles, magic, and the power of prophecy are common themes in Waterhouse's art. More specifically, the notion of woman as enchantress is one that recurs in images such as Circe Offering the Cup to Ulysees (1891, Oldham Art Gallery) and Hylas and the Nymphs (1896, Manchester City Art Gallery). His oeuvre also includes a number of middle-eastern subjects, in which he drew on the work of contemporary artists such as J.F Lewis (1805-76) and Lawrence Alma-Tadema (1836-1912), rather than on actual experience. This is one of Waterhouse's earlier works and reflects his fascination with the exotic.The woman in this picture appears to be a witch or priestess, endowed with magic powers, possibly the power of prophecy. Her dress and general appearance is highly eclectic, and is derived from several sources: she has the swarthy complexion of a woman of middle-eastern origin; her hairstyle is like that of an early Anglo-Saxon; her dress is decorated with Persian or Greek warriors. In her left hand, she holds a crescent-shaped sickle, linking her with the moon and Hecate. With the wand in her right hand, she draws a protective magic circle around her. Outside the circle the landscape is bare and barren; a group of rooks or ravens and a frog - all symbols of evil and associated with witchcraft - are excluded. But within its confines are flowers and the woman herself, objects of beauty.The meaning of the picture is unclear, but its mystery and exoticism struck a chord with contemporary observers. When the picture was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1886 the critic for the Magazine of Art wrote 'Mr. Waterhouse, in The Magic Circle, is still at his best - original in conception and pictorial in his results' (quoted in Hobson, p.37).	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--60908fadbb4ccb009f9c7766	00016b18b2--60908fadbb4ccb009f9c7766	APPROVED

When I was a young college student first getting out of my Christian fundamentalist upbringing bubble, I used to think that surely feminists, progressives, etc would be kind and good people because their beliefs (so I thought) stemmed from empathy toward others and wanting a better society. It was hard to learn that progressives can *also* be needlessly unkind, uncompassionate, spiteful, hateful, etc. Obviously not at the same rate or in the same way as bigoted racist alt righters, but it was a sad awakening. It was hard watching a professor of feminist theory who also liked to mock her own grad students in seminar until they almost cried.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609090c704eb6219ecd93180	00016b18b2--609090c704eb6219ecd93180	APPROVED

I’m from the UK.My great uncle (grandfather’s older brother) was a wonderful man. He didn’t have much money, but he had a wealth of wild stories that he used to tell me from his younger days. He also loved poetry. Any topic that came up in conversation - he’d be able to recite something related. My favourite stories of his came from the time he spent in the USA and Mexico in his 20’s (1950’s).It’s a long story, but to break it down: he joined the Canadian army and went AWOL a few months later with some friends of his. They spent the next two years travelling south. He used to talk about how he worked at fairgrounds in Chula Vista and how he also visited a childhood pen-pal who worked on a ranch in Texas.Eventually he was arrested near the Mexican border and deported back to England. The police apparently assumed he and his friends were illegal immigrants... which they were...I guess, but just not from Mexico. As I said, it’s quite a long story.He passed away last summer. He’d had dementia for several years, and he had already forgotten who I was about 5 years ago. I was still sad that I couldn’t visit him in hospital due to COVID. The care home he was living in cruelly threw away all of his possessions the day after he died before my parents could go and collect his things. My Dad managed to salvage one of his poetry books and a framed photo from the tip. Everything else was gone or ruined.He didn’t have much money, but he’s left me just a little bit. From that I would like to get something handmade from the region of the world that he loved so much. Just to remind me of him and his stories.I was hoping someone here may be familiar with traditional folk artists or crafts people? I was thinking a little ceramic Mexican skeleton would be perfect- especially if I could commission someone to give him the same hat, moustache and pipe that my uncle used to wear.Or I would be grateful if you can suggest any other traditional memorial items from the region that I could look into?	1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609090cc03acb656d03649f0	00016b18b2--609090cc03acb656d03649f0	APPROVED

My county elected a judge who is woman my age (29). The amount of horrible things I read in the comments literally every time her name is mentioned in a news story is so disgusting and discouraging. I could imagine getting into politics before. My skin is thick enough for legitimate criticism. But to be degraded and disparaged for being a young woman in power constantly, at every turn... I don't think I could handle it.

Until a few weeks ago I didn’t know what male gaze was so when I encountered this term I looked it up and educated myself on male gaze in film. However, today I saw a TikTok which mentioned internalized male gaze. People in the comments where asking what it is and others replied by saying it’s when you feel like you’re always being watched by a man. Can someone explain it in a better way?

The regular circular target used to be more commonly used. When the military realised most soldiers won't actually fire at someone even if they have a clear shot, they spent a lot of effort finding ways to desensitise people to violence. A lot of this was done through propaganda showing the enemy as not being human, but one simple change was during training to use targets shaped like people.This isn't sone novelty item. The purpose of these targets is to train people to be killers.	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609091e80fcbf23df04db13a	00016b18b2--609091e80fcbf23df04db13a	APPROVED

"The truth needs to get out about what feminism is really about. People hate on feminism either because they're misogynists or they just don't understand feminism. The lie that we hate men or want all women to become lesbians, practice witchcraft, or we want to destroy society needs to fucking stop already. We really need to get more people in charge of social media that will shut lies like that down quickly. Tumblr and Reddit needs it more so. People want to act like they're being censored and their free speech is being taken away just because social media companies cal out their lies and ban their bigotry, but oh fucking well. If I can't talk about wanting to defend myself from violence without a 3 day ban on Reddit or talk about how much the men in the Facebook comments section disgust me for defending a female teacher masturbating in front of her 2nd grade class without getting a 30 day ban for ""hate speech"" then neither should these motherfuckers be able to spew their word diarrhea. 🤷‍♀️"	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--6090925f0f8c70046198fec1	00016b18b2--6090925f0f8c70046198fec1	APPROVED

I’ve been having a difficult time with this as well. On one hand I can understand the need of uplifting an identity that is too often ignored or hyper criticized. But, I think that Beyonce being uplifted kind of shows the way that sexist and colorist ideals work within the black community. Beyonce would probably not be as famous if she was darker skin and didn’t play into the male gaze to sell her music. I also wonder how much her parents, getting into the business so young, and being apart of the rap/R&B scene during the era of misogynist rappers and singers such as R Kelly affected her own views.I was reading Demita Frazier (member of the Combahee River Collective) and her comments about Beyonce were eye opening. Frazier said that Beyonce is promoting sex positivity but if your a feminist the conversation should be ongoing and focus on other avenues as well such as devoting more money to educating young black girls or addressing misogyny in rap/R&B. Beyonce seems to have some feminist views but a lot of it seems clouded by overarching black liberation thinking (which still caters more to the liberation of black men).I wish the black community could uplift more females like Tierra whack or noname who talk about issues facing all types of black people without having to play into the jezebel stereotype that has haunted black women. But, too many people rather listen to artists who don’t really support the community which makes it harder to have conversations on issues affecting the community such as sexual violence. Also, we are already aware of how difficult it is for conscious black rappers and singers to make it in the mainstream because their thinkings have not been accepted by that same audience. I wonder why artists that only focus on sex, drugs, and money are more likely to be favored in mainstream society then people speaking about the obstacles they face like rap and R&B use to be.So, I guess the hate you received will probably be ongoing but just know that it is very common. Happens a lot to black women and black queers who dare to question the community that doesn’t understand the way that modern society views on gender, sexuality, and class have affected it own community’s views.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--6090925f0f8c70046198fec1	00016b18b2--6090925f0f8c70046198fec1	APPROVED

When I was a young college student first getting out of my Christian fundamentalist upbringing bubble, I used to think that surely feminists, progressives, etc would be kind and good people because their beliefs (so I thought) stemmed from empathy toward others and wanting a better society. It was hard to learn that progressives can *also* be needlessly unkind, uncompassionate, spiteful, hateful, etc. Obviously not at the same rate or in the same way as bigoted racist alt righters, but it was a sad awakening. It was hard watching a professor of feminist theory who also liked to mock her own grad students in seminar until they almost cried.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609092bc0fcbf23df04db676	00016b18b2--609092bc0fcbf23df04db676	APPROVED

I'm not sure if this is even allowed how to really ask, but I'm having wrist surgery tomorrow. This is the culmination of a partially misdiagnosed break back on Mother's Day. I'm scared. I have ocd related to forced changes in the body from a higher power and loss of limbs which I know - I KNOW - is irrational, but that is ocd. I also get migraines that cause constant hunger. I can't eat past 2200; I'm nocturnal, so I'll be up most of the night (also, see ocd).I'll be all alone in hospital, waiting alone to be put under, no active coping mechanisms. I'm scared. If you don't mind, if you have some good energy or thoughts to waste on me, if you can please spare a kind thought (I don't feel like I deserve it, but I'd like to ask anyway), I'll be put under around 1400. The moon is my guardian (full moon, first day of the three-month season of winter - that's good, right?) Also, a dear friend's mother is dying. Slowly. Any good you can send Emily's way will be appreciated.Thank you in advance.	1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609092e64a2a157622376587	00016b18b2--609092e64a2a157622376587	APPROVED

The police took me to the hospital (I was 15) and brought me through the back to get checked out. I told them I didn’t want my parents to know. Just my luck, my dad was there for a nose bleed, they saw me in the hall. Did a rape kit, for some medication to prevent HIV, took plan B and then gave a statement to the police. It took over a year to go trial. Met with a victim service worker who wasn’t very helpful and with the crown attorney a few times. A private investigator followed me around a few times and tried to question me and people I knew about me to get dirt on me. I was bullied really badly in high school and got into drugs and drinking. Lost a lot of friends and my family split. In the end one guy was plead guilty and was given 3 years (only because he was 26 and had raped 10 other girls, most minors) and the other got off with nothing. He ended up walking around town with a knife trying to find me but the cops got him and I had a restraining order put against him. I regret coming forward personally but I can see how it would be positive for some people. For me it just dragged out the experience and caused a lot more problems. Unfortunately I was sexually assaulted again at 21 and I’ve never told anyone and never will.	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609093d103acb656d0365f24	00016b18b2--609093d103acb656d0365f24	APPROVED

[Source](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/waterhouse-the-magic-circle-n01572)&nbsp;Miracles, magic, and the power of prophecy are common themes in Waterhouse's art. More specifically, the notion of woman as enchantress is one that recurs in images such as Circe Offering the Cup to Ulysees (1891, Oldham Art Gallery) and Hylas and the Nymphs (1896, Manchester City Art Gallery). His oeuvre also includes a number of middle-eastern subjects, in which he drew on the work of contemporary artists such as J.F Lewis (1805-76) and Lawrence Alma-Tadema (1836-1912), rather than on actual experience. This is one of Waterhouse's earlier works and reflects his fascination with the exotic.The woman in this picture appears to be a witch or priestess, endowed with magic powers, possibly the power of prophecy. Her dress and general appearance is highly eclectic, and is derived from several sources: she has the swarthy complexion of a woman of middle-eastern origin; her hairstyle is like that of an early Anglo-Saxon; her dress is decorated with Persian or Greek warriors. In her left hand, she holds a crescent-shaped sickle, linking her with the moon and Hecate. With the wand in her right hand, she draws a protective magic circle around her. Outside the circle the landscape is bare and barren; a group of rooks or ravens and a frog - all symbols of evil and associated with witchcraft - are excluded. But within its confines are flowers and the woman herself, objects of beauty.The meaning of the picture is unclear, but its mystery and exoticism struck a chord with contemporary observers. When the picture was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1886 the critic for the Magazine of Art wrote 'Mr. Waterhouse, in The Magic Circle, is still at his best - original in conception and pictorial in his results' (quoted in Hobson, p.37).	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--6090943f09c70d3ddc385564	00016b18b2--6090943f09c70d3ddc385564	APPROVED

Was driving home in a torrential downpour with tornado warnings on a Sunday. Had the kids in the car heading home. Drove by a local business that was closed and saw a young guy trying to take cover underneath the building overhang. He had his bicycle with him. He was just absolutely wrecked looking. I hurried home, got the kids out and into the house, ran in and grabbed an oversized PinkFloyd hoodie that I had, thinking it should fit him okay. I drove the few miles back down to where he was. Wheeled in and asked if he wanted help and a ride. He said yes and dropped his bike to jump in the car. He was freezing cold in a short sleeve shirt and shorts. Told him nah we’re going to take the bike too and we loaded it into the back of my vehicle. We both then jumped in, I gave him the hoodie to put on and I drove him home with his bike. Told him to keep the hoodie, he told me he didn’t think people like me really existed.In the amount of time it took me to go home, drop off my kids, get the vehicle ready to grab his bike quickly and the hoodie I can guarantee at least 50 cars must’ve gone by him. That’s awful. I was hoping he’d be gone when I got there; that someone else stopped to help.	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609094ade70f0974b18a7e40	00016b18b2--609094ade70f0974b18a7e40	APPROVED
Has reached the point of basic adulting (handsoap and hamdtowel in the bathroom, basic food staples in the kitchen). Not so exciting, but shows some pride in his home.

"I love to have an overall healthy lifestyle and I think it is really important, personally. I like to wake up at 5:30am and meditate, then workout. On Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday I do 45 minutes to an hour of (usually) vinyasa yoga. I'll follow a yoga video, with my favoutite channel being ""Breathe and Flow"".On Monday, Wednesday and Friday I do a full-body workout, which usually consists of five to six movements that incorporate the seven primal movements. Push, pull, squat, lunge, hinge (at the hips), twist and an animal movement (or walk/run). These full-body workouts are bodyweight movements or I'll add in fabric resistance bands (which I love) to make the movement harder. I'm not a fan of weights, though I applaud anyone that does them, that's badass.For cardio, I am not a fan of high-intensity cardio, I much prefer walks/hiking. So that's what I do, walking/hiking, and I'll always take my dog with me (I feel safer with her). I usually go for a 30+ minute walk in the afternoon. The one thing I love about a healthy lifestyle is that you can adjust it to what you want to do. If you don't like weights, don't do them. If you love yoga, do that! Maybe doing a sport is for you. It's just about finding a good strength and cardio training regime and a balanced diet.

Something interesting in relation to gp usage. I saw days for my region about gp access over the age range for men and women. The median usage for women of a general practice is twice per year between the age of 15 and 40. For men the median is 0.I asked the doctor presenting the data why that is and he said that men just don't generally have a reason to see a doctor over that time but women do.That means the women have a relationship with a general practice and have a chance to ask questions when they see the doctor.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609095117d9ddc487d5331a6	00016b18b2--609095117d9ddc487d5331a6	APPROVED

"Hi im a 14 year old boy from spain and since 7th grade we've been really getting this kind of ""feminist education"" were even in schools there is like graffitis that encourage women to become what they want and all that and ive been basically seen since 7th grade that they dont really care about us, i remember for example that in 7th grade when we were doing a swimming course in a centre outside the school when we were changing after the swimming class there were 2 women who worked there watching us change our clothes just standing up there without doing anything besides watching  and nobody said anything to them and obviously if it would've been the other way around there would've been a  big outrage by teachers and the female students and basically asides from that we also had feminist talks with fake information like ""only 0.01% of the rape allegations are fake""  and also how when they were giving us sexual education classes basically they were just teaching about no is no and just talking to the girls that they could always like back down and when like men hit women ( i think its named gender violence or something) and then also i feel like girls pretend that theres sexism against them like when they once made a hole power point with ""sexist comments about them"" but basically nothing really had to do with their gender for example, one of their sexist comments they got was a joke a male student made because one of the girls got the highest grade in an exam but she couldnt figure out who to make the screen projector work so he said something like "" too smart to get the highest mark but not to make the screen work and they tried to make us think it was sexist but in my opinion that could've been said to a male student anyway, and many other stuff has happened and i dont really feel like they care about us males anymore, it feels like they honestly dont give a fuck about our mental health and all besides our marks to make the school look good.Thanks for reading i will try to answer to  your comments after i wake up (its late in spain) because i have to go to sleep because theres school tomorrow.

"As a Marxist, I believe that even sex work is ""real work"" and that's why it needs to be abolished! After all, what happens at sweatshops and iPhone factories are real work as well and they're incredibly degrading. All forms of wage labor are exploitative to one degree or another.

TERFs spread pseudo-science about trans people and have a vitriolic hatred of trans women, and most so-called SWERFs are nothing like that towards sex workers!

I am extremely pro casual sex. I believe the pressure women face to make every sexual encounter some huge meaningful thing is a ridiculous standard. I'm not saying go out and fuck any and everybody but if you like someone physically and connect with them on that level there is nothing wrong with being intimate with them.

For men the median is 0.I asked the doctor presenting the data why that is and he said that men just don't generally have a reason to see a doctor over that time but women do.That means the women have a relationship with a general practice and have a chance to ask questions when they see the doctor.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609096bed2eb476f06332075	00016b18b2--609096bed2eb476f06332075	APPROVED

"Hi im a 14 year old boy from spain and since 7th grade we've been really getting this kind of ""feminist education"" were even in schools there is like graffitis that encourage women to become what they want and all that and ive been basically seen since 7th grade that they dont really care about us, i remember for example that in 7th grade when we were doing a swimming course in a centre outside the school when we were changing after the swimming class there were 2 women who worked there watching us change our clothes just standing up there without doing anything besides watching  and nobody said anything to them and obviously if it would've been the other way around there would've been a  big outrage by teachers and the female students and basically asides from that we also had feminist talks with fake information like ""only 0.01% of the rape allegations are fake""  and also how when they were giving us sexual education classes basically they were just teaching about no is no and just talking to the girls that they could always like back down and when like men hit women ( i think its named gender violence or something) and then also i feel like girls pretend that theres sexism against them like when they once made a hole power point with ""sexist comments about them"" but basically nothing really had to do with their gender for example, one of their sexist comments they got was a joke a male student made because one of the girls got the highest grade in an exam but she couldnt figure out who to make the screen projector work so he said something like "" too smart to get the highest mark but not to make the screen work and they tried to make us think it was sexist but in my opinion that could've been said to a male student anyway, and many other stuff has happened and i dont really feel like they care about us males anymore, it feels like they honestly dont give a fuck about our mental health and all besides our marks to make the school look good.Thanks for reading i will try to answer to  your comments after i wake up (its late in spain) because i have to go to sleep because theres school tomorrow.

"I am from a south asian household and one of the most significant way patriarchy is enforced is, a man always accompanies me when I am traveling for hours in a rented car.

I’m from the UK.My great uncle (grandfather’s older brother) was a wonderful man. He didn’t have much money, but he had a wealth of wild stories that he used to tell me from his younger days. He also loved poetry. Any topic that came up in conversation - he’d be able to recite something related. My favourite stories of his came from the time he spent in the USA and Mexico in his 20’s (1950’s).It’s a long story, but to break it down: he joined the Canadian army and went AWOL a few months later with some friends of his. They spent the next two years travelling south. He used to talk about how he worked at fairgrounds in Chula Vista and how he also visited a childhood pen-pal who worked on a ranch in Texas.Eventually he was arrested near the Mexican border and deported back to England. The police apparently assumed he and his friends were illegal immigrants... which they were...I guess, but just not from Mexico. As I said, it’s quite a long story.He passed away last summer. He’d had dementia for several years, and he had already forgotten who I was about 5 years ago. I was still sad that I couldn’t visit him in hospital due to COVID. The care home he was living in cruelly threw away all of his possessions the day after he died before my parents could go and collect his things. My Dad managed to salvage one of his poetry books and a framed photo from the tip. Everything else was gone or ruined.He didn’t have much money, but he’s left me just a little bit. From that I would like to get something handmade from the region of the world that he loved so much. Just to remind me of him and his stories.I was hoping someone here may be familiar with traditional folk artists or crafts people? I was thinking a little ceramic Mexican skeleton would be perfect- especially if I could commission someone to give him the same hat, moustache and pipe that my uncle used to wear.Or I would be grateful if you can suggest any other traditional memorial items from the region that I could look into?	1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--6090970357f2744231a2a28a	00016b18b2--6090970357f2744231a2a28a	APPROVED

As part of my doctorate in Counselling Psychology, I am writing my dissertation on individuals’ experiences of post-abortion counselling. I’ve received ethical approval from my university and I’m now looking to conduct interviews with individuals who have received counselling as abortion aftercare. The aim of this study is to find out more about what is and isn’t helpful for individuals receiving counselling after terminating a pregnancy. It’s hoped that this research will inform clinician awareness and the provision of appropriate support services for individuals who have terminated their pregnancies.If you have had post-abortion counselling and would be interested in learning more and potentially having a conversation with me, please [fill out this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdiW1tw0hsUA98lddb3vTZP7w_Kcnp_kYJKkvMdWqJI_WjTfg/viewform) and I'll reach out to you!

"I am from a south asian household and one of the most significant way patriarchy is enforced is, a man always accompanies me when I am traveling for hours in a rented car. Though I put up a fight, they barely listen and I am left with no other choice but to be okay with having a man traveling with me ""for my safety"" and no, they never trust the driver enough. My ex partner said if I really was a feminist I would have found alternative ways to travel and wouldn't have relied on them even if that will ensue extreme drama and family tension and inconvenience on my behalf. On the side note, I am always calling out my family for their sexist remarks and instill my opinions through rigourous debates, sometimes which turn to be fruitful.

It seems bizarre someone would make that assumption, as if some can't imagine a place for women's bodies outside sex . . . And I don't see how something having ancient roots legitimises it. Murder has ancient roots. You don't find people legitimising murder on that basis. It's ridiculous, and just an attempt to manipulate women, as usual, into accepting  justification that's really no justification even if it were true.&#x200B;This is really cool though, and quite interesting in showing how our tastes are affected by circumstance. I remember somewhere that it used to be normal to find a very nourished woman as the ideal until we started over-consuming . . .then being skinny became the in-thing for women.

They seem oblivious to the fact that a woman might not find him attractive or not be interested.

If any of these nazi/white supremacist idiots actually took the time to research the meaning of the runes and actually read up on norse scriptures like the Edda and The Havamal they’d be super disappointed to find nothing racist, even Vikings themselves were a super mixed people that went to live in the Middle East, Africa, Spain...	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--609097fcd2eb476f06332a1c	00016b18b2--609097fcd2eb476f06332a1c	APPROVED

As part of my doctorate in Counselling Psychology, I am writing my dissertation on individuals’ experiences of post-abortion counselling. I’ve received ethical approval from my university and I’m now looking to conduct interviews with individuals who have received counselling as abortion aftercare. The aim of this study is to find out more about what is and isn’t helpful for individuals receiving counselling after terminating a pregnancy. It’s hoped that this research will inform clinician awareness and the provision of appropriate support services for individuals who have terminated their pregnancies.If you have had post-abortion counselling and would be interested in learning more and potentially having a conversation with me, please [fill out this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdiW1tw0hsUA98lddb3vTZP7w_Kcnp_kYJKkvMdWqJI_WjTfg/viewform) and I'll reach out to you!

"I am from a south asian household and one of the most significant way patriarchy is enforced is, a man always accompanies me when I am traveling for hours in a rented car. Though I put up a fight, they barely listen and I am left with no other choice but to be okay with having a man traveling with me ""for my safety"" and no, they never trust the driver enough. My ex partner said if I really was a feminist I would have found alternative ways to travel and wouldn't have relied on them even if that will ensue extreme drama and family tension and inconvenience on my behalf. On the side note, I am always calling out my family for their sexist remarks and instill my opinions through rigourous debates, sometimes which turn to be fruitful.

Well, a friend and I had gone to the ER. A Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (or a SANE) did a rape kit on me. I’m a forensic science student, we just finished our rape and sexual assault chapter, and I have to say it was pretty weird being able to describe what was happening, what chemicals she was swabbing on my skin, what reactions happen to determine if he had left body fluids on me. I don’t know why, then, I had gone home and showered and scrubbed the places he had touched me raw. I should’ve studied harder and remembered that was one of the reasons evidence is compromised. My forensics final exam was that day, actually. I got a seventy-five. About a month later, I reported it to the police. They had me write down what happened, the detective read my statement. He had me recount it verbally to him. He asked me questions and tried to catch me in a lie. The detective said he thought it was fishy that I couldn’t remember what time it happened, how many drinks I had, etc but I could remember the actual assault in extreme detail. I said well, yeah, I wish I didn’t remember it that detailed, I have flashbacks about it every day. Nothing happened. They called me a while later asking me to come in again, they accused me of cheating on my boyfriend because they found ‘another mans’ dna inside me (my bf) and not my assaulter’s. The detective asked if I had any contact with my assaulter since then, because I’d go through all of this for fun or something? They said it was my word against his. Nothing came of it at all	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--60909a21078ece51891e163e	00016b18b2--60909a21078ece51891e163e	APPROVED

Hey everyone,I work at a restaurant and have for a couple years. A co worker only addressed me as “hey beautiful”, “what’s up gorgeous”, “what’s up good lookin”.

It seems bizarre someone would make that assumption, as if some can't imagine a place for women's bodies outside sex . . . And I don't see how something having ancient roots legitimises it. Murder has ancient roots. You don't find people legitimising murder on that basis. It's ridiculous, and just an attempt to manipulate women, as usual, into accepting  justification that's really no justification even if it were true.&#x200B;This is really cool though, and quite interesting in showing how our tastes are affected by circumstance. I remember somewhere that it used to be normal to find a very nourished woman as the ideal until we started over-consuming . . .then being skinny became the in-thing for women.

"I love to have an overall healthy lifestyle and I think it is really important, personally. I like to wake up at 5:30am and meditate, then workout. On Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday I do 45 minutes to an hour of (usually) vinyasa yoga. I'll follow a yoga video, with my favoutite channel being ""Breathe and Flow"".On Monday, Wednesday and Friday I do a full-body workout, which usually consists of five to six movements that incorporate the seven primal movements. Push, pull, squat, lunge, hinge (at the hips), twist and an animal movement (or walk/run). These full-body workouts are bodyweight movements or I'll add in fabric resistance bands (which I love) to make the movement harder. I'm not a fan of weights, though I applaud anyone that does them, that's badass.For cardio, I am not a fan of high-intensity cardio, I much prefer walks/hiking. So that's what I do, walking/hiking, and I'll always take my dog with me (I feel safer with her). I usually go for a 30+ minute walk in the afternoon. The one thing I love about a healthy lifestyle is that you can adjust it to what you want to do. If you don't like weights, don't do them. If you love yoga, do that! Maybe doing a sport is for you. It's just about finding a good strength and cardio training regime and a balanced diet.

Both of ma parents were alcoholics. Dad became a Christian and stopped drinking when I was 12 or 13. Mom, partly for spite and partly because it was the first time Dad went and did something without her permission, upped her drinking game to the bottomless wine goblet from the moment she came home until she went to bed. If she was annoyed about something at work, she took it out on the first person in her sights, usually me.  I started staying in my room to avoid her, or go out with friends to get out of the house. She was verbally abusive and even a straight A report card in school would draw criticism. We had an intervention with her, and she continued to drink. I would not let my children stay with her as I could not trust her with them.  Ironically, Dad, who did not drink for the last 35+ years of his life, died from cirrhosis, and Mom died from congestive heart failure.  Yes, this very much influenced my choice of people I dated. If you were drunk, I wouldn’t go out more than once. Even today, I limit my intake. My brother has repeated my parents habits and is an alcoholic, verbally abusive as well. After Dad died, I pretty much cut off all contact with him.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--60909cd90f15e875b154bedb	00016b18b2--60909cd90f15e875b154bedb	APPROVED

I'm not sure if this is even allowed how to really ask, but I'm having wrist surgery tomorrow. This is the culmination of a partially misdiagnosed break back on Mother's Day. I'm scared.

The regular circular target used to be more commonly used. When the military realised most soldiers won't actually fire at someone even if they have a clear shot, they spent a lot of effort finding ways to desensitise people to violence.

I’m from the UK.My great uncle (grandfather’s older brother) was a wonderful man. He didn’t have much money, but he had a wealth of wild stories that he used to tell me from his younger days. He also loved poetry. Any topic that came up in conversation - he’d be able to recite something related. My favourite stories of his came from the time he spent in the USA and Mexico in his 20’s (1950’s).It’s a long story, but to break it down: he joined the Canadian army and went AWOL a few months later with some friends of his. They spent the next two years travelling south. He used to talk about how he worked at fairgrounds in Chula Vista and how he also visited a childhood pen-pal who worked on a ranch in Texas.Eventually he was arrested near the Mexican border and deported back to England. The police apparently assumed he and his friends were illegal immigrants... which they were...I guess, but just not from Mexico. As I said, it’s quite a long story.He passed away last summer. He’d had dementia for several years, and he had already forgotten who I was about 5 years ago. I was still sad that I couldn’t visit him in hospital due to COVID. The care home he was living in cruelly threw away all of his possessions the day after he died before my parents could go and collect his things. My Dad managed to salvage one of his poetry books and a framed photo from the tip. Everything else was gone or ruined.He didn’t have much money, but he’s left me just a little bit. From that I would like to get something handmade from the region of the world that he loved so much. Just to remind me of him and his stories.I was hoping someone here may be familiar with traditional folk artists or crafts people? I was thinking a little ceramic Mexican skeleton would be perfect- especially if I could commission someone to give him the same hat, moustache and pipe that my uncle used to wear.Or I would be grateful if you can suggest any other traditional memorial items from the region that I could look into?	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--60909e6dd2eb476f06336aee	00016b18b2--60909e6dd2eb476f06336aee	APPROVED

Both of ma parents were alcoholics. Dad became a Christian and stopped drinking when I was 12 or 13. Mom, partly for spite and partly because it was the first time Dad went and did something without her permission, upped her drinking game to the bottomless wine goblet from the moment she came home until she went to bed. If she was annoyed about something at work, she took it out on the first person in her sights, usually me.  I started staying in my room to avoid her, or go out with friends to get out of the house. She was verbally abusive and even a straight A report card in school would draw criticism. We had an intervention with her, and she continued to drink. I would not let my children stay with her as I could not trust her with them.  Ironically, Dad, who did not drink for the last 35+ years of his life, died from cirrhosis, and Mom died from congestive heart failure.  Yes, this very much influenced my choice of people I dated. If you were drunk, I wouldn’t go out more than once. Even today, I limit my intake. My brother has repeated my parents habits and is an alcoholic, verbally abusive as well. After Dad died, I pretty much cut off all contact with him.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--60909f40aae37140692ed33a	00016b18b2--60909f40aae37140692ed33a	APPROVED

I am extremely pro casual sex. I believe the pressure women face to make every sexual encounter some huge meaningful thing is a ridiculous standard.

Well, a friend and I had gone to the ER. A Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (or a SANE) did a rape kit on me. I’m a forensic science student, we just finished our rape and sexual assault chapter, and I have to say it was pretty weird being able to describe what was happening, what chemicals she was swabbing on my skin, what reactions happen to determine if he had left body fluids on me. I don’t know why, then, I had gone home and showered and scrubbed the places he had touched me raw. I should’ve studied harder and remembered that was one of the reasons evidence is compromised. My forensics final exam was that day, actually. I got a seventy-five. About a month later, I reported it to the police. They had me write down what happened, the detective read my statement. He had me recount it verbally to him. He asked me questions and tried to catch me in a lie. The detective said he thought it was fishy that I couldn’t remember what time it happened, how many drinks I had, etc but I could remember the actual assault in extreme detail. I said well, yeah, I wish I didn’t remember it that detailed, I have flashbacks about it every day. Nothing happened. They called me a while later asking me to come in again, they accused me of cheating on my boyfriend because they found ‘another mans’ dna inside me (my bf) and not my assaulter’s. The detective asked if I had any contact with my assaulter since then, because I’d go through all of this for fun or something? They said it was my word against his. Nothing came of it at all	-1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--6090a130ca4cce13cb310be3	00016b18b2--6090a130ca4cce13cb310be3	APPROVED

I'm not sure if this is even allowed how to really ask, but I'm having wrist surgery tomorrow. This is the culmination of a partially misdiagnosed break back on Mother's Day. I'm scared. I have ocd related to forced changes in the body from a higher power and loss of limbs which I know - I KNOW - is irrational, but that is ocd. I also get migraines that cause constant hunger. I can't eat past 2200; I'm nocturnal, so I'll be up most of the night (also, see ocd).I'll be all alone in hospital, waiting alone to be put under, no active coping mechanisms. I'm scared. If you don't mind, if you have some good energy or thoughts to waste on me, if you can please spare a kind thought (I don't feel like I deserve it, but I'd like to ask anyway), I'll be put under around 1400.

"I love to have an overall healthy lifestyle and I think it is really important, personally. I like to wake up at 5:30am and meditate, then workout. On Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday I do 45 minutes to an hour of (usually) vinyasa yoga. I'll follow a yoga video, with my favoutite channel being ""Breathe and Flow"".On Monday, Wednesday and Friday I do a full-body workout, which usually consists of five to six movements that incorporate the seven primal movements. Push, pull, squat, lunge, hinge (at the hips), twist and an animal movement (or walk/run). These full-body workouts are bodyweight movements or I'll add in fabric resistance bands (which I love) to make the movement harder. I'm not a fan of weights, though I applaud anyone that does them, that's badass.For cardio, I am not a fan of high-intensity cardio, I much prefer walks/hiking. So that's what I do, walking/hiking, and I'll always take my dog with me (I feel safer with her). I usually go for a 30+ minute walk in the afternoon. The one thing I love about a healthy lifestyle is that you can adjust it to what you want to do. If you don't like weights, don't do them. If you love yoga, do that! Maybe doing a sport is for you. It's just about finding a good strength and cardio training regime and a balanced diet.

[Source](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/waterhouse-the-magic-circle-n01572)&nbsp;Miracles, magic, and the power of prophecy are common themes in Waterhouse's art. More specifically, the notion of woman as enchantress is one that recurs in images such as Circe Offering the Cup to Ulysees (1891, Oldham Art Gallery) and Hylas and the Nymphs (1896, Manchester City Art Gallery). His oeuvre also includes a number of middle-eastern subjects, in which he drew on the work of contemporary artists such as J.F Lewis (1805-76) and Lawrence Alma-Tadema (1836-1912), rather than on actual experience. This is one of Waterhouse's earlier works and reflects his fascination with the exotic.The woman in this picture appears to be a witch or priestess, endowed with magic powers, possibly the power of prophecy. Her dress and general appearance is highly eclectic, and is derived from several sources: she has the swarthy complexion of a woman of middle-eastern origin; her hairstyle is like that of an early Anglo-Saxon; her dress is decorated with Persian or Greek warriors. In her left hand, she holds a crescent-shaped sickle, linking her with the moon and Hecate. With the wand in her right hand, she draws a protective magic circle around her. Outside the circle the landscape is bare and barren; a group of rooks or ravens and a frog - all symbols of evil and associated with witchcraft - are excluded. But within its confines are flowers and the woman herself, objects of beauty.The meaning of the picture is unclear, but its mystery and exoticism struck a chord with contemporary observers.

The regular circular target used to be more commonly used. When the military realised most soldiers won't actually fire at someone even if they have a clear shot, they spent a lot of effort finding ways to desensitise people to violence. A lot of this was done through propaganda showing the enemy as not being human, but one simple change was during training to use targets shaped like people.This isn't sone novelty item. The purpose of these targets is to train people to be killers.	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--6090bf1909c70d3ddc3a8f0c	00016b18b2--6090bf1909c70d3ddc3a8f0c	APPROVED

It seems bizarre someone would make that assumption, as if some can't imagine a place for women's bodies outside sex . . . And I don't see how something having ancient roots legitimises it. Murder has ancient roots. You don't find people legitimising murder on that basis. It's ridiculous, and just an attempt to manipulate women, as usual, into accepting  justification that's really no justification even if it were true.&#x200B;This is really cool though, and quite interesting in showing how our tastes are affected by circumstance. I remember somewhere that it used to be normal to find a very nourished woman as the ideal until we started over-consuming . . .then being skinny became the in-thing for women.

"""Why do you have to be such a bitch?""Said to me by my good friend in high school. I was section leader of the percussionists in band, and I was telling him to play his instrument properly because he was being lazy. He was probably having a bad day and I didn't realize it. But it still hurt that he lashed out at me"	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--6090c218e313a106d82bc45e	00016b18b2--6090c218e313a106d82bc45e	APPROVED
I am extremely pro casual sex. I believe the pressure women face to make every sexual encounter some huge meaningful thing is a ridiculous standard. I'm not saying go out and fuck any and everybody but if you like someone physically and connect with them on that level there is nothing wrong with being intimate with them. Use protection & open communication with anyone who you are engaging with. As for me I've had partners where we both knew it was strictly casual sex and it was great through out the whole thing	0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--6090c218e313a106d82bc45e	00016b18b2--6090c218e313a106d82bc45e	APPROVED

I can adapt very easily and I learn quickly. This is great for when I’m starting a new job. No one usually asks me how, but employers and coworkers will often comment on how quick I pick up things.Also, I love reading all these replies and learning about everyone’s little superpowers. :)	1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/23795890/00016b18b2--6090c218e313a106d82bc45e	00016b18b2--6090c218e313a106d82bc45e	APPROVED
